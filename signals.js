        "description": "Last September, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) unleashed teams of robots on simulated mass-casualty scenarios, including an airplane crash and a night ambush. The robots\u2019 job was to find victims and estimate the severity of their injuries, with the goal of helping human medics get to the people who need them the most.Kimberly ElenbergKimberly Elenberg is a principal project scientist with the Auton Lab of Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Robotics Institute. Before joining CMU, Elenberg spent 28 years as an army and U.S. Public Health Service nurse, which included 19 deployments and serving as the principal strategist for incident response at the Pentagon.The final event of the DARPA Triage Challenge will take place in November, and Team Chiron from Carnegie Mellon University will be competing, using a squad of quadruped robots and drones. The team is led by Kimberly Elenberg, whose 28-year career as an army and U.S. Public Health Service nurse took her from combat surgical teams to incident response strategy at the Pentagon.Why do we need robots for triage?Kimberly Elenberg: We simply do not have enough responders for mass-casualty incidents. The drones and ground robots that we\u2019re developing can give us the perspective that we need to identify where people are, assess who\u2019s most at risk, and figure out how responders can get to them most efficiently.When could you have used robots like these?Elenberg: On the way to one of the challenge events, there was a four-car accident on a back road. For me on my own, that was a mass-casualty event. I could hear some people yelling and see others walking around, and so I was able to reason that those people could breathe and move.In the fourth car, I had to crawl inside to reach a gentleman who was slumped over with an occluded airway. I was able to lift his head until I could hear him breathing. I could see that he was hemorrhaging and feel that he was going into shock because his skin was cold. A robot couldn\u2019t have gotten inside of the car to make those assessments.This challenge involves enabling robots to remotely collect this data\u2014can they detect heart rate from changes in skin color or hear breathing from a distance? If I\u2019d had these capabilities, it would have helped me identify the person at greatest risk and gotten to them first.How do you design tech for triage?Elenberg: The system has to be simple. For example, I can\u2019t have a device that\u2019s going to force a medic to take their hands away from their patient. What we came up with is a vest-mounted Android phone that flips down at chest height to display a map that has the GPS location of all of the casualties on it and their triage priority as colored dots, autonomously populated from the team of robots.Are the robots living up to the hype?Elenberg: From my time in service, I know the only way to understand true capability is to build it, test it, and break it. With this challenge, I\u2019m learning through end-to-end systems integration\u2014sensing, communications, autonomy, and field testing in real environments. This is art and science coming together, and while the technology still has limitations, the pace of progress is extraordinary.What would be a win for you?Elenberg: I already feel like we\u2019ve won. Showing responders exactly where casualties are and estimating who needs attention most\u2014that\u2019s a huge step forward for disaster medicine. The next milestone is recognizing specific injury patterns and the likely life-saving interventions needed, but that will come.This article appears in the January 2026 print issue as \u201cKimberly Elenberg.\u201d",

        "description": "Every September as we plan our January tech forecast issue, IEEE Spectrum\u2019s editors survey their beats and seek out promising projects that could solve seemingly intractable problems or transform entire industries.Often these projects fly under the radar of the popular technology press, which these days seems more interested in the personalities driving Big Tech companies than in the technology itself. We go our own way here, getting out into the field to bring you news of the hidden gems that genuinely\u2014as the IEEE motto goes\u2014advance technology for the benefit of humanity.A look back at the last 20 years of January issues reveals that while we\u2019ve certainly covered our share of huge tech projects, like the James Webb Space Telescope, many of the stories touch on subjects most people would have otherwise missed.Last January, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz reported on startups that are piloting ocean-based carbon capture. This issue, she\u2019s back with another CO2-centric story, this time focused on grid-scale storage, which is poised to blow up\u2014literally. Waltz traveled to Sardinia to check out Milan-based Energy Dome\u2019s \u201cbubble battery,\u201d which can store up to 200 megawatt-hours by compressing and decompressing pure carbon dioxide inside an inflatable dome.This kind of modular, easy-to-deploy energy storage could be especially useful for AI data centers, says Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, who curated this issue and wrote about gravity energy storage back in January 2021.Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquefy cancer tumors. \u201cWhen we think about energy storage, our minds usually go to grid-scale batteries,\u201d Moore says. \u201cYet these bubbles, which are in many ways more capable than batteries, will be sprouting up all over the place, often in association with computing infrastructure.\u201dFor his story in this issue, Moore dove into the competition between two startups that are developing radio-based cables to replace conventional copper cables and fiber optics in data centers. These radio systems can connect processors 10 to 20 meters apart using a third of the power of optical-fiber cables and at a third of the cost. The next step is to integrate the radio connections directly with GPUs, to ease cooling burdens and help data centers and the AI models running on them continue to scale up.Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquify cancer tumors, as Greg Uyeno found when reporting on HistoSonics\u2019 ultrasound treatment. Feared for its aggressive nature and extremely low survival rate, pancreatic cancer kills almost half a million people per year worldwide. HistoSonics uses noninvasive, focused ultrasound to create cavitation bubbles that destroy tumors without dangerously heating surrounding tissue. This year, the company is concluding kidney trials as well as launching pancreatic cancer trials.Over the last two decades, Spectrum has regularly covered the rise of drones. In 2018, for instance, we reported that the startup Zipline would deploy autonomous drones to deliver blood and medical supplies in rural Rwanda. Today, Zipline has a market cap of about US $4 billion and operates in several African countries, Japan, and the United States, having completed almost 2 million drone deliveries. In this issue, journalist Robb Mandelbaum takes us inside the Wildfire XPrize competition, aimed at providing another life-saving service: dousing wildfires before they grow out of control. Zipline succeeded because it could make deliveries to remote locations much faster than land vehicles. This year\u2019s XPrize teams plan to detect and suppress fires faster than conventional firefighting methods.In addition to these emerging technologies, we\u2019ve packed this issue with a dozen others, including Porsche\u2019s wireless home charger for EVs, the world\u2019s first electric air taxi service, neutral-atom quantum computers, interoperable mesh networks, and robotic baseball umpires. Let\u2019s see which of this year\u2019s picks make it to the big leagues.",

        "description": "SummaryJoby Aviation is realizing Uber\u2019s original \u201cElevate\u201d dream, moving electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft from science fiction toward commercial reality.By 2026, Joby aims to inaugurate the world\u2019s first integrated air taxi network\u2014in Dubai\u2014leveraging aggressive local infrastructure investment to bypass Western bureaucratic hurdles.The plan includes \u201cvertiports\u201d at strategic hubs like Dubai International Airport, creating the essential physical and digital ecosystem required for reliable point-to-point urban flight.While facing a cautious FAA in the U.S., Joby will use its Dubai operations to bridge the gap between experimental testing and full-scale passenger operations.Ten years ago, ride-sharing giant Uber embraced a sci-fi future in which clean, quiet electric aircraft would shuttle passengers around crowded cities. Uber\u2019s well-funded Elevate initiative, which included a white paper and three high-profile annual summits, effectively launched the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) industry, promising investors, regulators, and the general public that these futuristic flying taxis were \u201ccloser than you think.\u201dAt the time, California-based Joby Aviation was still in stealth mode. But behind the scenes, this pioneering eVTOL developer\u2014which has received more than US $3 billion in total funding, including around $900 million from Toyota\u2014was playing a major role in shaping Uber\u2019s vision. It later stepped in to keep that vision alive, acquiring the Elevate program in 2020 after Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi decided to axe it.Now, Joby, which was founded in 2009 and has become the dominant eVTOL startup, says it is finally on the verge of making \u201curban air mobility\u201d a reality. It plans to conduct its first passenger flights in 2026 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.This article is part of our special report Top Tech 2026.\u201cDubai continues to be our global launchpad for commercial service, and our progress here is a testament to the UAE\u2019s visionary approach to advanced air mobility,\u201d says Anthony Khoury, Joby\u2019s UAE general manager, in an email interview. \u201cDubai is on track to be the first city in the world to offer a fully integrated, premium air taxi network, and we are sprinting toward that target.\u201dJoby Struck a Six-Year Exclusive Deal with DubaiThe company first announced its UAE plans at the World Governments Summit in Dubai in February 2024, striking a deal with Dubai\u2019s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that gives it an exclusive right to operate air taxis there for six years from the launch of commercial operations.Joby\u2019s exclusive Dubai deal will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis Joby also signed an agreement with U.K.-based Skyports to design, build, and operate four \u201cvertiport\u201d sites in Dubai\u2014places for the eVTOL aircraft to load and unload passengers and charge their batteries. The first vertiport will be near Dubai International Airport, with additional ones planned for Dubai Mall, the Atlantis the Royal resort, and American University in Dubai.Joby won\u2019t be the first eVTOL developer to carry passengers. That distinction goes to China\u2019s EHang, which is already conducting limited sightseeing and demonstration flights with its two-seat, autonomous electric multicopters. (Joby\u2019s aircraft are piloted.) If Joby pulls off its goal, however, it will be the first to routinely fly passengers from point to point over urban traffic, in keeping with Uber Elevate\u2019s original vision. Its exclusive agreement in Dubai will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis, which includes a handful of other Western eVTOL developers, plus a growing number of Chinese players. Besides its Dubai deal, Joby also has a partnership with Delta to start an airport shuttle service in the United States. The Joby S4 electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has six electric motors, each weighing 28 kilograms and capable of a peak output of 236 kilowatts.Joby AviationOperating a reliable air taxi service is a demanding proposition that will require Joby\u2019s aircraft, charging infrastructure, and scheduling software to perform safely and reliably day in and day out. Since every new and complex technology has teething problems, Joby envisions fairly limited initial operations in 2026.\u201cWe will transition from test flights to more complex proving runs and eventually nonpaying passenger flights out of the completed vertiports, ensuring a seamless passenger experience ahead of full commercial launch,\u201d says Khoury. He adds that Joby is currently working with Skyports to ready its initial vertiports and with government agencies in Dubai and the UAE to receive the necessary approvals for its operations.\u201cDubai\u2019s approach is deeper and more comprehensive than what you see in many of the headlines,\u201d said Clint Harper, an aviation infrastructure and policy advisor who recently participated in an advanced air mobility workshop with Dubai\u2019s RTA. \u201cIn our workshop,\u201d he says, \u201cthe RTA staff had fantastic questions and concerns regarding safety, security, and system-level integration. Everyone recognized and appreciated strong government support and wanted to deliver the right system solution, not just a one-off demo. I was thoroughly impressed and inspired.\u201dInitial Air Operations Will Precede an Airworthiness CertificateNotably, all of this groundwork is taking place in advance of Joby receiving an initial type certificate for its aircraft from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the United States (and elsewhere), a type certificate is typically a prerequisite for conducting commercial operations with paying passengers. Joby claims it\u2019s making good progress toward FAA certification, but how quickly (or slowly) that process moves is largely out of its hands. In recent years, the FAA has been taking longer to certify even conventional airplanes and helicopters, which the industry blames on staffing shortages at the agency and more cautious decision-making in the wake of the Boeing 737 Max crisis.This perception that certification delays have more to do with bureaucracy than safety may be why Dubai is willing to approve some early operations by Joby in advance of FAA type certification. Interestingly, the United States is now following the UAE\u2019s example. In September, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation began soliciting proposals for an eVTOL Integration Pilot Program (eIPP), which will select at least five projects to demonstrate eVTOL operations in the national airspace starting as early as summer 2026.The FAA has stated that the eIPP won\u2019t allow eVTOL developers to bypass certification requirements or carry paying passengers. However, it will enable them to undertake additional testing and demonstration flights as a stepping-stone to commercial operations. Joby says it\u2019s planning to take part in the eIPP, meaning its air taxis could also be flying over U.S. cities in 2026\u2014even if the only person on board is the pilot.",

We also post a weekly calendar of upcoming robotics events for the next few months. Please send us your events for inclusion.ICRA 2026: 1\u20135 June 2026, VIENNAEnjoy today\u2019s videos! To train the next generation of autonomous robots, scientists at Toyota Research Institute are working with Toyota Manufacturing to deploy them on the factory floor.[ Toyota Research Institute ]Thanks, Erin!This is just one story (of many) about how we tried, failed, and learned how to improve our \u202adrone delivery system.Okay, but like you didn\u2019t show the really cool bit...?[ Zipline ]We\u2019re introducing KinetIQ, an AI framework developed by Humanoid, for end-to-end orchestration of humanoid robot fleets. KinetIQ coordinates wheeled and bipedal robots within a single system, managing both fleet-level operations and individual robot behavior across multiple environments. The framework operates across four cognitive layers, from task allocation and workflow optimization to task execution based on Vision-Language-Action models and whole-body control taught by reinforcement learning, and is shown here running across our wheeled industrial robots and bipedal R&amp;D platform.[ Humanoid ]What if a robot gets damaged during operation? Can it still perform its mission without immediate repair? Inspired by the self-embodied resilience strategies of stick insects, we developed a decentralized adaptive resilient neural control system (DARCON). This system allows legged robots to autonomously adapt to limb loss, ensuring mission success despite mechanical failure. This innovative approach leads to a future of truly resilient, self-recovering robotics.[ VISTEC ]Thanks, Poramate!This animation shows Perseverance\u2019s point of view during a drive of 807 feet (246 meters) along the rim of Jezero Crater on 10 December 2025, the 1,709th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. Captured over 2 hours and 35 minutes, 53 navigation-camera (Navcam) image pairs were combined with rover data on orientation, wheel speed, and steering angle, as well as data from Perseverance\u2019s inertial measurement unit, and placed into a 3D virtual environment. The result is this reconstruction with virtual frames inserted about every 4 inches (0.1 meters) of drive progress.[ NASA Jet Propulsion Lab ]\u221247.4 \u00b0C, 130,000 steps, 89.75\u00b0E, 47.21\u00b0N\u2026 On the extremely cold snowfields of Altay, the birthplace of human skiing, Unitree\u2019s humanoid robot G1 left behind a unique set of marks.[ Unitree ]Representing and understanding 3D environments in a structured manner is crucial for autonomous agents to navigate and reason about their surroundings. In this work, we propose an enhanced hierarchical 3D scene graph that integrates open-vocabulary features across multiple abstraction levels and supports object-relational reasoning. Our approach leverages a vision language model (VLM) to infer semantic relationships. Notably, we introduce a task-reasoning module that combines large language models and a VLM to interpret the scene graph\u2019s semantic and relational information, enabling agents to reason about tasks and interact with their environment more intelligently. We validate our method by deploying it on a quadruped robot in multiple environments and tasks, highlighting its ability to reason about them.[ Norwegian University of Science & Technology, Autonomous Robots Lab ]Thanks, Kostas!We present HoLoArm, a quadrotor with compliant arms inspired by the nodus structure of dragonfly wings. This design provides natural flexibility and resilience while preserving flight stability, which is further reinforced by the integration of a reinforcement-learning control policy that enhances both recovery and hovering performance.[ HO Lab via IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters ]In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of our knowledge the first end-to-end vision-based autonomous-drone racing policy that maps directly from pixel-level representations to motor commands.[ MAVLab ]This video showcases AI Worker, equipped with five-finger hands, performing dexterous object manipulation across diverse environments. Through teleoperation, the robot demonstrates precise, humanlike hand control in a variety of manipulation tasks.[ Robotis ]Autonomous following, 45-degree slope climbing, and reliable payload transport in extreme winter conditions, built to support operations where environments push the limits.[ DEEP Robotics ]Living architectures, from plants to beehives, adapt continuously to their environments through self-organization. In this work, we introduce the concept of architectural swarms: systems that integrate swarm robotics into modular architectural fa\u00e7ades. The Swarm Garden exemplifies how architectural swarms can transform the built environment, enabling \u201cliving-like\u201d architecture for functional and creative applications.[ SSR Lab via Science Robotics ]Here are a couple of IROS 2025 keynotes, featuring Bram Vanderborght and Kyu-Jin Cho.  - YouTube  www.youtube.com  [ IROS 2025 ]",
