                                    "description": "RSAF is one of the most technologically advanced and forward-looking air forces in Southeast Asia. To stay strategically relevant in an era defined by autonomous systems, RSAF, working closely with DSTA, set out to build the foundation for mission autonomy. The goal was to create the ability to develop, test, and control autonomous systems in- house, aligned with RSAF\u2019s Concepts of Operations (CONOPs). To accelerate this effort, RSAF and DSTA partnered with Shield AI to use Hivemind Enterprise, an AI-powered suite of software tools for unmanned systems to operate autonomously. Together, the teams aimed to develop, test, and scale intelligent mission software that could operate across both single and teams of unmanned systems. RSAF and DSTA faced several key challenges in reaching their mission autonomy goals. They needed autonomous systems that could perform safely and reliably while adapting to changing mission conditions. Integrating this technology across different aircraft, flight zones, and mission types added complexity, especially when missions involved restricted airspace or rapid route changes. Beyond the technical hurdles, RSAF and DSTA wanted to build what it calls sovereign capability \u2014 the ability to design, test, and manage its own autonomous systems without depending on foreign technology or outside expertise. This was as much about national security and self-reliance as it was about innovation. Shield AI\u2019s Hivemind Enterprise provided the framework for RSAF and DSTA\u2019s autonomy development program. Built for speed, flexibility, and compatibility across multiple aircraft types, Hivemind allowed RSAF and DSTA engineers to quickly design, test, and refine mission behaviors using easy-to-use, production-ready tools. In 2025, RSAF and DSTA engineers began hands-on training through Hivemind\u2019s integrated autonomy environment. During one demonstration, an Ascent SPIRIT aircraft carried out a search and rescue exercise across two flight zones separated by restricted airspace. When the system failed to locate the object of interest, in the first zone, it automatically rerouted around the restricted area, searched the second zone, located the object of interest, and returned safely to base. The test highlighted Hivemind\u2019s ability to plan, adapt, and complete missions independently in dynamic environments. Looking ahead, RSAF and DSTA plan to expand these capabilities by developing manned and unmanned teaming in 2026 and introduce cooperative multi-aircraft operations by 2027. Hivemind\u2019s flexible design ensures these advancements can be deployed seamlessly across RSAF\u2019s fleet. faster toward pilotless flight and coordinated multi aircraft The collaboration has reshaped how RSAF and DSTA develop and deploy mission autonomy. By adopting Hivemind Enterprise, RSAF and DSTA established a fully self-reliant development process that allows its engineers to design, test, and deploy autonomous mission software in Singapore. The partnership also proved Hivemind\u2019s ability to handle real world challenges, from adapting flight paths to operating safely in complex airspace. RSAF and DSTA are now moving faster toward pilotless flight and coordinated multi aircraft operations, reinforcing Singapore\u2019s position as a leader in defense technology and self-sustained innovation. Through its partnership with Shield AI, RSAF and DSTA are building the foundation for the next era of intelligent airpower, where human expertise and autonomous systems work together to achieve mission success and strengthen national resilience.

                                    "description": "WASHINGTON (February 19, 2026) \u2013 Shield AI, in partnership with the Navy\u2019s Strike Planning and Execution (PMA-281) and Aerial Targets (PMA-208) programs, successfully demonstrated Hivemind, its AI-enabled mission autonomy software, autonomously flying two Navy BQM-177A aircraft during a December flight test at Point Mugu Sea Range in California. The flight served as the capstone event of a multi-month integration and test campaign and followed an initial August demonstration, during which Hivemind first flew the BQM-177A to validate Advanced Vehicle Control Laws (AVCL) and integrate foundational autonomous behaviors. In this capstone event, Hivemind piloted two BQM-177As in a Live-Virtual-Constructive (LVC) environment that included a virtual F-18 and constructive adversary aircraft. The autonomous aircraft executed coordinated defensive behaviors\u2014maneuvering to defend designated Combat Air Patrol (CAP) positions as adversaries attempted to penetrate those areas or target friendly forces. The event showcased more advanced autonomous decision-making than previous tests and progressed integration with the Navy\u2019s Autonomy Government Reference Architecture (A-GRA), supporting future interoperability across unmanned platforms. \u201cThis demonstration highlights Hivemind\u2019s ability to operate as a low-risk, adaptable autonomy stack integrated onto a Navy platform,\u201d said Christian Gutierrez, vice president of Hivemind Solutions at Shield AI. \u201cWe appreciate the Navy\u2019s continued partnership as we move these capabilities forward. Developing mission autonomy that excels in operational environments requires rigor, collaboration, and close coordination with operators, and these events reflect that joint effort.\u201d Hivemind is Shield AI\u2019s core artificial intelligence software that assumes the role of a human pilot or operator, enabling unmanned defense systems to sense, decide, and act. Unlike traditional autopilots that simply follow preplanned routes, Hivemind can reroute around no-fly zones, avoid or engage obstacles, respond to unexpected conditions, and complete missions safely and effectively without human intervention. Hivemind is A-GRA-compliant, platform\u2011agnostic, and has demonstrated A\u2011GRA aligned flight operations across multiple government and industry test efforts. Originally designed as a high-performance aerial target, the BQM-177A served in this event as a surrogate autonomy research platform, generating insights that may inform the Navy\u2019s emerging thinking around future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) concepts and unmanned teaming roles. Shield AI served as the lead systems integrator and mission autonomy provider for the event, managing platform modification, payload integration, and technical coordination across industry and government stakeholders. In 2024, the Navy selected Shield AI to integrate Hivemind onto the Kratos-built BQM-177A and develop a prototype testbed for autonomous flight. The capstone flight represents a key engineering milestone, and an inflection point for continued development and fleet experimentation in 2026 and beyond. Founded in 2015, Shield AI is a venture-backed deep-tech company with the mission of protecting service members and civilians with intelligent systems. Its products include the V-BAT and X-BAT aircraft, Hivemind Enterprise, and the Hivemind Vision product lines.

Building on existing explorations and early use cases, the expansion looks to develop and embed autonomous capabilities across multiple drone\u2019s applications, using the SDK to tailor AI solutions for current operational and future environments. The collaboration has allowed RSAF and DSTA to use Shield AI\u2019s SDK to independently design, test, and deploy mission autonomy. Within six months, operational and developer feedback from the RSAF and DSTA has led to refinements to the SDK, strengthening their developers\u2019 capability to develop and deploy mission autonomy for RSAF\u2019s Concept of Operations (CONOPs). The mission autonomy thus supports users in completing missions safely and effectively without human intervention and is able to reroute around no-fly zones, avoid threats and respond to unexpected conditions. \u201cRSAF and DSTA have been outstanding partners,\u201d said Brandon Tseng, Shield AI\u2019s president and co-founder. \u201cThrough their adoption of the Hivemind platform, Singapore is on a path to become the first country outside the United States with true sovereign autonomy, meaning the ability to develop and field its own AI pilots across its platforms. This matters because autonomy is a way to decouple military fighting strength from population size, and in Singapore\u2019s case, from a declining population, a challenge many nations around the world also face.\u201d \u201cBuilding our capability to independently develop and field mission autonomy is a priority and an important step forward,\u201d said DSTA\u2019s chief executive Mr Ng Chad-Son. \u201cThis collaboration goes beyond technology adoption. It allows our defence engineers and aircrew to develop hands-on experience that will grow a sustainable pipeline of AI specialists with good operational understanding. We will continue to leverage market solutions to integrate autonomy across a broader spectrum of applications for the RSAF, ensuring our unmanned systems are highly adaptable and mission-ready for any challenge.\u201d The agreement was announced during the Singapore Airshow 2026, where Brandon Tseng participated in a panel on autonomy and human-machine teaming.

                                    "description": "The U.S. Air Force and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. recently completed a successful manned-unmanned teamed demonstration between an F-22 Raptor and an MQ-20 Avenger unmanned aircraft, advancing the integration of autonomous systems into tactical fighter operations, according to a Feb. 23 company release. The live-flight exercise, conducted at Edwards Air Force Base in California, featured a human-piloted F-22 issuing real-time commands to the MQ-20 via advanced autonomy software and a tactical data link. The Avenger drone responded by executing a range of mission tasks, including waypoint navigation, combat air patrol patterns and simulated engagement of airborne threats, functioning as a direct force extender for the manned platform, according to the release. The demonstration leveraged government-provided reference autonomy software on the F-22 and GA-ASI\u2019s Autonodyne Bashi Pilot Vehicle Interface aboard the MQ-20. Onboard sensors enabled the unmanned aircraft to process information independently, coordinate maneuvers and exchange tactical messages with the Raptor in a continuous command loop between the two aircraft. \u201cWe appreciate the flawless execution of this mission using the government\u2019s advanced autonomous systems,\u201d said General Atomics President David R. Alexander. \u201cThis demo featured the integration of mission elements and the ability of autonomy to utilize onboard sensors to make independent decisions and execute commands from the F-22.\u201d The demo, meanwhile, builds on General Atomics\u2019 accelerating timeline for the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. On Feb. 12, the Air Force announced validation of the Autonomy Government Reference Architecture, or A-GRA, across multiple vendors. This included successful integration of Collins Aerospace\u2019s Sidekick software on the General Atomics YFQ-42A CCA for its first semi-autonomous airborne mission. The YFQ-42A, officially nicknamed \u201cDark Merlin\u201d in a separate press release on Feb. 23, executed precise commands for more than four hours under ground operator control, validating reliable data exchange and autonomy execution that support advanced manned-unmanned teaming, such as the recent MQ-20/F-22 demo. The Edwards demonstration is the latest in a series of tests underscoring the Air Force\u2019s priority on pairing fifth-generation fighters with autonomous unmanned aircraft. Such teaming concepts aim to boost lethality, extend sensor reach and enhance survivability in contested environments by enabling pilots to delegate tactical tasks to drones while retaining command authority for complex decisions.",

                                    "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. \u2014 The conclusion of the Army\u2019s inaugural Best Drone Warfighter Competition saw soldiers awarded in Best Operator, Best Innovation and Best Tactical Squad categories. On hand to present awards to the winners, who were selected from more than 200 competitors during the Feb. 17-19 event, were Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Maj. Gen. Clair A. Gill, commanding general of the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence. Driscoll, who flew to the Huntsville, Alabama, ceremony after participating in Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, spoke to Military Times about the significance of the event and how it will inform the future of drone warfare and the scaling of unmanned systems. In remarks shared ahead of the ceremony, Driscoll told Military Times that he hopes the Army will be in position to buy one million drones within the next 18 to 24 months. \u201cA lot of what we\u2019ve been spending the last year doing is reorienting a lot of our systems so that a drone is not thought of as a piece of equipment that a soldier will have to sign out of an arms room and return, but more like an ammunition or a round that you take to a range,\u201d he said. Asked about his near-term goals for scaling drone production, Driscoll said the Army is currently focusing on assessing new drone technology for design and potential use. \u201cI think our near-term goals are more qualitative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as an Army have got to figure out how to reset how we think about purchasing things like drones, how we think about training on things like drones and how we think about repairing them on the edge.\u201d Driscoll maintained that there is no time to waste when it comes to building drones and integrating them throughout the force. The existing ability of adversarial nations to build and deploy unmanned systems makes that evolution paramount, he said. \u201cWe know if we look at our threats around the world, like in China or other nations that are producing 5 million to 15 million drones, we are short of that in both our commercial and military sector,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we need to get to a place where we can scale quickly to match them.\u201d Driscoll and Gill told Military Times that the Army is planning to launch a drone marketplace next month, which will allow private industry to market and sell drone innovations throughout the service. Products will be rated and reviewed, with increased competition expected to drive prices down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to allow the consumers \u2014 that\u2019s our soldiers and our units \u2014 to rate the equipment that\u2019s being sold there,\u201d Gill said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to allow for a natural free market economy to drive the best product.\u201d Driscoll said that the combined efforts of soldiers and private industry, in addition to the efforts of lawmakers, will help the Army meet its goals to increase manufacturing. \u201cI think the urgency is there,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cIf you talk to members of Congress, whether it\u2019s a defense prime or a startup, everyone knows we have to solve this problem. If you go speak to any of these soldiers out here, the talent and the innovation is there.\u201d The Army secretary added that the military\u2019s sense of urgency has ramped up due to the rapid surge of threats unmanned systems pose to national security. \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is just the sheer magnitude of the problem that is required and the concept of these layered defenses,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cThe biggest thing that we in the United States Army and as federal officials and Americans face, the biggest dilemma, is how broad of the threat exists and how you layer in solutions that can take into account how much territory is required to be defended.\u201d Driscoll and Gill presented award plaques to the winning soldiers, including a team assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment that took home the prize for Best Tactical Squad. Meanwhile, 1st Sgt. Javon Purchner earned the title of Best Operator for his drone racing skills, and the Army National Guard\u2019s 28th Infantry Division clinched the award for Best",

                                    "description": "MILAN \u2014 Armed with a fresh defense-cooperation agreement, Denmark and Canada stand to exploit their shared use of MQ-9B drones as a practical touchpoint for Arctic surveillance, according to issue experts. The Danish Air Force officially established Squadron 729 on Feb. 16, which will operate the four MQ-9B long-range unmanned aircraft out of Aalborg Air Base, located in northern Denmark, starting from 2028. Earlier this month, Canada, which has acquired 11 of the same General Atomics-made drones that it will receive around the same time, signed a defense cooperation agreement with Denmark at the Munich Security Conference. The systems are planned to be based in different locations, including Nova Scotia on the east coast and British Columbia on the Canadian west coast. The team-up brings together two Arctic nations that have repeatedly drawn the ire of Donald Trump since he assumed his second term as U.S. president in early 2025. Trump harbors a grudge against Canada for not wanting to be part of the United States, and against Denmark for having no interest in giving him the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland. The defense-technical nexus around the MQ-9B drone holds promise in forging a closer connection between Ottawa and Copenhagen, as there is currently no formal maintenance-sharing or data-sharing arrangement between the two nations, according to issue experts. \u201cA joint logistics or maintenance hub would absolutely be strategically beneficial for them \u2013 maintaining equipment and operating bases in the region is very expensive \u2013 sharing facilities and having an integrated logistics system can make operations easier and more efficient for all parties involved,\u201d Jens Marquard S\u00f8rensen, director of a Danish consulting company, said. Still, both countries must first evaluate whether their operational plans match up. For example, basing the Danish fleet at Aalborg Air Base would colocate the equipment with air force maintenance expertise there, but it\u2019s a long way from strategic patrol points in Greenland, said S\u00f8rensen. \u201cThe long distances [from Aalborg] to Greenland may pose operational challenges \u2013 flight times are long, increasing wear on drones before they arrive for a mission, and they would lose fuel going there. \u2026 It also means that any kind of rapid reaction using the MQ-9Bs is not possible, so having a forward operating station in the Arctic itself would be a notable advantage,\u201d he said. To put this into perspective, the straight-line distance between the Danish air base and Nuuk is approximately 3,324 kilometres (2,065 miles), and commercial jets covering the same route average flight times of about four to five hours. Rune Raunow, a defense consultant at the Copenhagen-based Rethink Advisory, which advises the Danish Armed Forces, said a Denmark-Canada pact around the U.S.-made surveillance drones would be especially relevant for contingency plans, refueling or emergency landings. Cooperation on sensors, too, could factor into the equation, Raunow said. While the Canadian government has opted for L3 Harris Wescam MX-20D sensor systems for intelligence and surveillance missions, Denmark has not publicly disclosed its preference. \u201cThe drones are essentially just a platform; what will be more relevant is whether they will buy the same set of communication networks, sensors, optic detection systems, etc. \u2026 Being able to track threats in these very remote places would be extremely easier if they were using the same equipment,\u201d Raunow said. Canada\u2019s MQ-9B purchase was driven by its need to bolster Arctic operations and provide continuous intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, according to government statements. While stationing its fleet in southern bases is consistent with existing airfields and maintenance infrastructure, these areas are still far from the high Arctic and other regional chokepoints, where the country has increased monitoring needs. S\u00f8rensen suggests that if NATO was to re-open the Keflav\u00ed",

                                    "description": "The alliance needs to close the drone gap with Russia in the High North \u2014 before it is too late. Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the return of high-intensity competition to the High North, a region that was perceived as a peripheral corner of global geopolitics for much of the post\u2013Cold War era. As the United States and NATO Arctic allies hold intense debate about security throughout the region and begin to integrate drones for collective defense and deterrence, they face an uncomfortable reality: Russia is moving faster. A growing gap has emerged between the alliance\u2019s ambition to defend the High North and its ability to field Arctic-capable uncrewed systems at scale. The future of Arctic security will hinge not only on submarines, missiles, fighter jets and icebreakers, but on the capacity to deploy, sustain and counter uncrewed systems in extreme conditions and unprecedented numbers. In this specific competition, Russia can leverage a significant edge. It fields the world\u2019s largest industrial-scale drone ecosystem outside China and is institutionalizing combat lessons from Ukraine. Like Kyiv, Moscow has established a dedicated branch for uncrewed systems, expanded mass-training of drone operators, and is forming new drone units across the joint force, including within the Northern Fleet. It is also investing in Arctic-adapted platforms and command centers for long-range maritime drones. Annual production now exceeds 1.5 million units, with Western intelligence services expecting sharp increases driven by Chinese industrial support and sanctions evasion. In the Arctic, Russia is likely to use drones as integrated force multipliers: enabling persistent ISR along Arctic littorals and the Northern Sea Route, cueing Bastion coastal defense systems, supporting anti-submarine and anti-surface operations and conducting long-range strikes with one-way attack drones alongside traditional missiles. These activities will be tightly coupled with aggressive cyber and electronic warfare to degrade allied sensing, targeting and command-and-control capabilities. For NATO, uncrewed systems may matter more in the Arctic than in any other theater. Vast distances, sparse infrastructure and extreme weather constrain human presence and amplify gaps in domain awareness and response times. Traditional crewed platforms such as maritime patrol aircraft, submarines and ice-capable vessels remain essential but are limited in number and costly to sustain. Even with renewed investments, they cannot alone provide the persistent surveillance, logistics, and targeting required by NATO\u2019s regional defense plans. Drones help fill this gap. They can offer unmatched persistence, scalability, and flexibility at lower operational cost and risk to personnel, conducting a wide array of tasks, from reconnaissance and surveillance to logistic and resupply, casualty evacuation, mine and countermine operations, strike and more. In short, uncrewed systems are no longer niche enablers but indispensable elements for strengthening deterrence and defense in the Arctic. Procuring advanced platforms, however, does not automatically translate into usable capability. NATO faces structural challenges that limit its ability to exploit drones in the High North. First, most systems are not designed for Arctic conditions. Extreme cold degrades batteries, icing affects propulsion and sensors, communications become unreliable, and corrosion accelerates wear. As a result, NATO suffers from a shortage of uncrewed systems certified for sustained cold-weather operations. Second, infrastructure is sparse, complicating logistical support. Airfields, ports, and repair facilities are limited, while satellite coverage above 75\u00b0N is degraded and less reliable. Therefore, any robotization strategy must include adequate sustainment across the board. These challenges make reliance on autonomous features and GNSS-denied navigation essential, though the latter raises system co",

                                    "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. \u2014 Drones are profoundly changing the Army\u2019s approach to aviation and combined arms training, Maj. Gen. Clair A. Gill, commanding general of the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence, told Military Times in an interview. During the Army\u2019s first annual Best Drone Warfighter Competition in Huntsville, Alabama, the Fort Rucker-based aviation chief shared his insights about the impact of drones on military doctrine. \u201cThe application of drone technology is only limited by your creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s this constantly evolving game of technology and craftsmanship to create the desired effect that you want on the other end.\u201d While Army aviators are no strangers to unmanned systems, drones being fielded today are immensely different from those developed over the last two decades, many of which tended to be larger and required more manpower to operate, Gill said. \u201cIn the last five to 10 years I would say we have seen a complete shift in what drone technology is and how it can be used,\u201d Gill said. The net result, he added, is that drones are \u201cno longer just the purview of Army aviation.\u201d \u201cI would argue now with the proliferation of small drones and how cheap and effective they can be that Army aviation is just one minor user now. ... Everybody is going to have drones in the airspace to some degree. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change everything. The nature of war is the same. It\u2019s always an endeavor of human conflict. But the character of war is just fundamentally different.\u201d Drones have been used successfully as a force multiplier in a variety of global conflicts, from Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan to the Middle East and Ukraine. While the U.S. Army is adapting its approaches based on observing other forces around the world, Gill stressed that there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to drone warfare. The U.S. Army must develop drone combat doctrine in line with its unique capabilities, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the Ukrainian army, nor are we the Russian army,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just fundamentally operate differently.\u201d Gill told Military Times that observers from the Army Aviation Center of Excellence are currently embedded with Ukraine\u2019s Security Assistance Group, or SAG-U, to study lessons from the conflict. However, fighting methods from Ukraine should not be broadly applied to American forces, he noted, due to differences in U.S. tactics and capabilities. \u201cWe would be fools not to pay attention and not to take a lot of lessons from them, which we\u2019re doing, but we can\u2019t take the wrong lessons,\u201d Gill said. \u201cJust because it didn\u2019t work in Russia-Ukraine doesn\u2019t mean it might not work for us.\u201d The tactical element of the Army\u2019s drone competition gave soldiers the chance to test drone aviation abilities while leveraging field skills on a hunter-killer mission, during which each team was afforded a single reconnaissance FPV drone and up to five \u201ckiller\u201d drones. \u201cThat really is the application of the technology,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThey have to be able to use the technology in the context of what it is that we do, not just fly the drone.\u201d The tactical challenge gave leadership an opportunity to observe with the aim of refining training, doctrine and approaches to drone combat operations. Gill explained that restructuring within Army commands has allowed analysis teams to be established at each Army Center of Excellence, including those dedicated to aviation, maneuver and fires. \u201cWe\u2019ve restructured our subordinate teams and we have something called a Transformation Integration Directorate, TID, and within them they have a Transformation Lesson Learned Manager, a TLLM,\u201d he explained. These managers are responsible for evaluating all observations and establishing what lessons are useful to the Army before uploading them into a new database system called Project Victor. Powered by generative AI technology, the system will give soldiers broad access to whitepapers, studies and useful information about operating drones in the field. \u201cThat should be a dat",

Project RED, which stands for Recovery Exploitation Drone, is built to fly over and inspect downed unmanned aircraft systems. The system uses artificial intelligence software to discern the difference between friendly and enemy drones. Using a robotic arm with a claw, it can pick up a fallen drone and transport it to troops for evaluation or repair. The unit, part of the Pennsylvania National Guard, built the robotic arm using 3D printing. It is made of carbon fiber, and can easily be replicated. At the awards ceremony Thursday, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll presented the winning service members with an honorary plaque. The team also received a drone prototype from the Army Research Laboratory and a one-year contract for the lab to help with design improvements for Project RED.

Dubbed \u201cthe Gauntlet,\u201d military operators will fly and evaluate uncrewed aerial systems, or UASs, at Fort Benning, Georgia, to determine which of the 25 competing vendors will advance to the next phase of the program. However, ahead of the testing, DOD curated a list of commercial drones that meet baseline performance and compliance standards. With the list, officials aim to streamline procurement and encourage military leaders to begin buying and fielding approved systems sooner rather than later. In December, the Defense Contract Management Agency launched the Blue List UAS website, which catalogs 54 drone models cleared, at a minimum, for training use. Of those, 29 also received the \u201cselect\u201d label, indicating they passed a competitive review process and are authorized for operational deployment. With so many drone models available and the pace of change accelerating, a central question of what DOD is looking for in a commercial drone remains. Although many observers point to use of expendable drones in the Russia-Ukraine war as motivation behind the program, DOD first established the Blue UAS program in 2020 to mitigate cybersecurity risks and reduce reliance on foreign-made components. The Blue UAS program emerged from the National Defense Authorization Act, which prohibits the federal government from using drones and drone components from countries considered a security risk. Experts say the Blue UAS program takes NDAA compliant drones a step further. For a drone to be added to the Blue UAS list, it must pass rigorous testing and cyber security evaluations. In other words, a Blue UAS is an NDAA-compliant drone that\u2019s been officially tested in the field for performance and approved by the Pentagon. And the Blue UAS designator continues to matter. According to a report by the Institute for Defense & Government Advancement, Chinese companies dominate the global drone supply chain with an estimated 90% control of the commercial drone market. In turn, it\u2019s difficult to manufacture drones without using Chinese-made parts. \u201cWhile these Chinese-made motors are referred to as \u201cdumb components\u201d experts say the issue is less about espionage risk and more about availability and resilience,\u201d the IDGA report said. \u201cIn a conflict or trade disruption, U.S. drone production could stall almost immediately due to reliance on Chinese supply chains.\u201d Using the Blue UAS designator, the Pentagon, along with the federal government as a whole, aim to not just equip troops with new technology but to also boost domestic drone production. For its part, the Pentagon\u2019s plan is to invest over $1 billion in the U.S. drone market over the next two years through the Drone Dominance Program. Following the \u201cGauntlet\u201d testing, which is scheduled to end in March, it will resume testing every six months until 2028. By the end of the program, the department aims to have acquired some 300,000 drones and named five primary vendors.",

                                    "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama \u2014 Soldiers from across the U.S. Army showcased drone warfare skills and ideas in the service\u2019s first annual Best Drone Warfighter Competition held here this week. The competition, launched on Tuesday, is an Army event sponsored by the Army Aviation Association of America. It drew over 800 attendees and competing teams drawn from every Army unit. It mirrors existing Army competitions such as Best Sapper, Best Ranger and Best Sniper, with emphasis on drone warfare. Soldiers compete in three lanes for the titles of Best Operator, Best Tactical Hunter-Killer Team, and Best Innovation. The lanes include a drone racing obstacle course, a cross-country field exercise in which soldiers pair up to take out targets, and an innovation lane which sees soldiers showcase drone technology they\u2019ve developed to a panel of five judges. \u201cThese lanes absolutely inform and tell us what kind of skills we need to train to make them the best at what we expect them to do,\u201d Col. Nicholas Ryan, director of Army UAS Transformation and Lessons Learned Manager at the Army\u2019s Aviation Center of Excellence, told Military Times. The focus of the competition is not on gaining points or acclaim but developing recipes for success in the unmanned domain, Ryan said. All lanes focus on gathering input from soldiers about what drone technology is proving effective and why, encouraging participants to share solutions. Additionally, the innovation lane gives soldiers experience with building and modifying their drone equipment - an essential skill in the fast-moving domain. \u201cThat fabrication and modification aspect is also something we\u2019ve taken from Ukraine because that\u2019s what their operators do and it\u2019s necessary for them to adjust their equipment to meet their mission demands,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt is now built into our UAS training courses teaching them how to 3-D print, how to design, how to code and how to build their own drones.\u201d Soldiers competing in the Best Operator lane raced Neros Archer FPV drones. The Neros was chosen to establish a baseline for competitors to showcase their skills on a standard drone platform, offering a modular design that is easy to repair. The lane saw soldiers fly drones through an intricate obstacle course and perform complex maneuvers. While some operators were not used to racing, Captain Jacob Bickus, officer in charge of the Army Drone Team, told Military Times that hands-on practice is essential to build skills through familiarity. \u201cEven though it\u2019s racing, it\u2019s still good practice for them to build their skills,\u201d Bickus said. Asked what makes a good drone operator, Bickus told Military Times that the most important quality is to have an open mind. \u201cThey have to be creative and innovative, and have an engineer problem-solving mindset because with these drones there are so many intricacies and knowledge you have to have to be able to proficiently operate them,\u201d he said. Future iterations of the Army competition event could incorporate drone swarm tactics, though that depends on the pace of developing technology, Ryan told Military Times. \u201cWe absolutely want it in the Army, and want to use it in the Army. It\u2019s not there just yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is absolutely a task and a requirement we do want to incorporate which we refer to as the one-to-many control, so one operator controlling many drones simultaneously.\u201d Drones are now an essential tool within the Army and the competition will help identify how the service can strengthen existing capabilities, Ryan explained. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that is going to be a common capability and piece of equipment across every formation of every type and any group of soldiers,\u201d Ryan said. He added that fully autonomous systems may be suitable to performing some basic tasks for the Army in the future. \u201cThere will be so many mission sets that drones can do and various types of technology across ranges of autonomy, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at very closely as well.\u201d Zita B",

                                    "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama \u2014 The U.S. Army\u2019s Apache attack helicopter AH-64 broke new ground by firing 30mm proximity ammunition at drones in air-to-air combat during a December exercise in Yuma, Arizona, according to the service. The live fire test saw Apache pilots engage drones flying on ranges at Yuma Proving Ground using the 30x113mm XM1225 Aviation Proximity Explosive, called APEX. The APEX rounds have proximity fuzes that cause them to detonate when they close in on a target, releasing a wide radius of blast fragments. The 30mm rounds are designed to be fired at targets requiring precision to hit, such as small boats, drones and enemy combatants, without requiring changes to the Apache\u2019s existing weapon system. The fragments excelled at destroying drones in flight, the service has stated, in addition to being effective against ground targets. \u201cThe XM1225\u2019s proximity fuze has the potential to increase soft-skinned ground and aerial target vulnerability, providing the Attack [Division] community an additional capability so long as those targets are susceptible to detection, classification, and tracking,\u201d Maj. Vincent Franchino, test pilot and Attack Division chief at Redstone Test Center in Huntsville, Alabama, said in a statement. The APEX technology was developed in-house by the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command\u2019s Armaments Center, with support from Picatinny Arsenal and Northrop Grumman. Proximity fuzes have a long history within the U.S. military. The first were developed by the United States during World War II and were used against aircraft and Germany\u2019s V-1 flying bombs. The move to upgrade helicopter weapons capabilities for drone warfare is part of the Army\u2019s drive to modernize combat units to address and incorporate unmanned systems. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George announced last month that the service will begin fielding the Bell MV-75 tiltrotor aircraft by the end of this year and that larger unmanned aerial systems classed in Groups 3, 4 and 5 are being integrated into Army combat aviation brigades.

                                    "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 Australia is one of the pioneers exploring collaborative combat aircraft, or CCAs, as it throws its full weight behind Boeing Defence Australia\u2019s MQ-28A Ghost Bat platform. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) already has eight Block 1 aircraft in testing. In addition, the first of three Block 2 aircraft ordered in February 2024 is currently performing ground testing and will fly soon, according to the manufacturer. On Dec. 9, 2025, Boeing Defence Australia announced the RAAF had ordered seven additional Ghost Bats. This third tranche worth AUS$754 million (US$534 million) entails six CCAs in Block 2 configuration plus the first-ever Block 3 aircraft. This will put the Australian air force on a path to have 10 operational Ghost Bats by 2028. Australia, worried by the military rise of China, is prioritizing long-range deterrence. Unmanned systems like the Ghost Bat are a prominent part of that puzzle, allowing Australia to project airpower far from its shores. Boeing Defence Australia conducted two demonstrations in recent months. The first involved a pair of MQ-28As flying in formation, with an E-7A Wedgetail early-warning aircraft acting as a quarterback. \u201cThat mission was to go out there against a representative target at a representative range and achieve the find, fix, track, target piece of the air-to-air kill chain,\u201d Glen Ferguson, MQ-28 Global Program Director at Boeing Defence, said at the Singapore Airshow this month. What followed was the MQ-28A\u2019s first-ever missile firing on Dec. 8, 2025. This involved a Ghost Bat launching an externally mounted AIM-120 AMRAAM against a Phoenix drone. An F/A-18F Super Hornet fed targeting data, while an E-7A provided command and control. \u201cWe did the engage-assess part of the kill chain, and we did it on purpose to show that all spectrums of the mission can be covered through a mix of crewed and uncrewed teaming,\u201d Ferguson said. The Block 3\u2019s internal weapons bay is provisioned to carry one AMRAAM-sized or two GBU-39/B bomb-sized weapons. Boeing has trialed an electronic warfare payload and infrared seeker, as well as three or four other sensor packages that Ferguson declined to discuss. \u201cThe thing about CCAs that we\u2019re learning is they\u2019re not replacement aircraft,\u201d he said. According Pat Conroy, Australia\u2019s minister for defense industry, the government is eying a fleet mix of at least least three uncrewed aerial platforms for every crewed combat aircraft. Construction of a Ghost Bat production facility in Toowoomba, Queensland, will conclude this year, allowing it to begin operations in 2027. Australia\u2019s goal is for a Ghost Bat to cost 10% of a crewed combat aircraft, a target that Boeing believes it can reach. \u201cWe\u2019re really, really comfortable with our affordability,\u201d said Ferguson. \u201cWe\u2019ve built this aircraft from day one to be affordable.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re having conversations with a lot of customers right now about how they might feel or determine or deliver a CCA capability,\u201d said Ferguson, who mentioned Japan as a potential collaborator. Despite Boeing\u2019s early start in the CCA testing business, Ghost Bat is not without competitors. Anduril Industries exhibited its Fury \u2013 designated the YFQ-44 by the U.S. Air Force \u2013 in Australia last year. General Atomics is also working on its Gambit family of collaborative combat aircraft. Gordon Arthur is an Asia correspondent for Defense News.

                                    "description": "The U.S. Army\u2019s Global Response Force will begin assessing the Bumblebee V2 drone interceptor in March following a $5.2 million contract award inked on January 30 by the Pentagon. The Defense Department\u2019s Joint Interagency Task Force 401 announced the agreement with Perennial Autonomy on February 4, which will see deliveries of the Bumblebee V2 start next month. The Bumblebee V2, a first-person view drone with four rotors, acts as its own drone hunter-killer system. Advanced artificial intelligence software enables it to identify other unmanned aerial vehicles and engage them in combat. It attacks other drones and knocks them out of the sky with a direct physical collision. \u201cThis decision puts kinetic [counter-small] UAS capability into the hands of our troops immediately,\u201d Army Brig. Gen. Matthew Ross, JIATF-401 director, said in a statement. \u201cThe Bumblebee V2 provides a cost-effective, reliable interceptor that can neutralize threats without endangering our own forces or surrounding infrastructure. On the modern battlefield, where drones are a constant threat, having a low-collateral kinetic option is not just an advantage; it is increasingly becoming essential for protecting our forces.\u201d Direct physical strikes on unmanned aerial vehicles, known as \u201chard kills,\u201d can produce a blast radius and scatter sharp debris when munitions are used. With a drone-on-drone strike, the Bumblebee minimizes these risks. Having one flying drone tackle another eliminates the need for bullets and potentially harmful explosions. This potential could see the Bumblebee used efficiently in urban areas. Additionally, the system is compliant with updated regulations in the National Defense Authorization Act, which has strict requirements for the use of foreign components. Drones with NDAA compliance, such as the HANX drone developed by the U.S. Marines, can be adopted for military use with immediate effect. The Army\u2019s Global Response Force will assess the system in support of the Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin Joint Innovation Outpost, a new facility opened at Fort Bragg on Jan. 3 to bring together soldiers, academics and private industry to develop and test new technology.

                                    "description": "The Pentagon wants sensors that can detect small drones threatening military installations across the United States. \u201cDue to the urgency of the threat and the need to assess capability readiness,\u201d the Defense Innovation Unit needs products in time for a spring 2026 demonstration a Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, according to a DIU solicitation. \u201cInvited companies may have 30 days or less between notification and execution of the demonstration,\u201d the solicitation adds. The project, titled \u201cCounter UAS Sensing for Homeland and Mobile Defense,\u201d seems aimed at both civil defense and battlefield protection. The first track is protection of installations in the U.S. In this case, the sensors must detect Group 1 UAVs \u2014 the smallest category, weighing less than 20 pounds \u2014 at a minimum range of 2 kilometers. A secondary attribute is the ability to spot Group 2 and 3 drones, or those weighing less than 1,320 pounds. Sensors should also be able to screen out ground clutter and birds, according to the request. \u201cSolutions may employ single or multimodal sensing to enhance the radar solution, however the solution must include a radar sensor as part of the total proposal,\u201d the DIU solicitation states. The goal appears to be deploying sensors that can be used for both detection and destruction of drones, including \u201crapid integration capability with government designated CUAS fire control systems.\u201d The solicitation did not specify whether this would involve protecting military or civilian sites. However, it did state that systems must \u201coperate safely near populated areas, within congested airspace, and across complex electromagnetic environments dominated by lawful emitters.\u201d The DIU project\u2019s second track aims to provide mobile counter-drone sensors for small military units that are on the move. Equally important, these sensors themselves have to avoid being detected and targeted by enemy fire, which has been a problem for electronic warfare emitters in the Ukraine war. \u201cThe solution\u2019s ability to deliver early warning, allowing units to take protective action, is critical and depends upon a low physical and spectral signature to prevent targeting by enemy forces,\u201d said DIU. \u201cAll sensing modalities are welcome, with preference for passive approaches.\u201d Sensors must detect Group 1 and 2 drones flying below 50 meters. Other desired attributes include multiple and redundant sensors, minimal setup time and \u201cbroadspectrum RF [radio frequency] sensing (e.g., approximately 400 MHz\u20138 GHz) for passive solutions, including adaptability to evolving UAS data links.\u201d DIU is also looking for robust systems that troops can maintain themselves. \u201cThe system must reduce operator burden with intuitive controls for detection, tracking, and alert management,\u201d the solicitation said. \u201cIt must be configurable and adaptable by tactical operators to the dynamic front-line RF environment without requiring support from engineering personnel.\u201d Interestingly, these C-UAS sensors seem aimed more at trucks and light vehicles than armored vehicles. The system, the solicitation states, must be capable of being mounted on the Infantry Squad Vehicle, Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles and the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck.

                                    "description": "SINGAPORE \u2014 Beyond China\u2019s ostentatious display of its J-35A fighter jet at the Singapore Airshow was a lower-profile piece of equipment, the new Wing-Loong X combat drone, which experts say is far more likely to find international success. Beijing banked on Asia\u2019s largest aerospace event, organized here from Feb. 3-7, to flex its aviation muscle, in a bid to attract more customers. At the enormous booth of the country\u2019s top aerospace manufacturer, Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, placed in the center of the exhibition hall, a mock-up of the WL-X combat drone was displayed on the side. It was the first time the latest member of the Wing Loong family of drones, designed for maritime surveillance and strike missions, was shown in the Southeast Asia region. Whereas Chinese military equipment may have been previously overlooked, experts say that the context has changed, as its systems are being taken more seriously, especially in the drone category. \u201cChinese products are not only being noticed in the West, but their aircraft and combat drones are also being recognized as competitors \u2013 the capability gap between these systems and their U.S. competitors is narrowing while maintaining significantly lower costs,\u201d Andreas Rupprecht, a military aviation researcher specializing in China, said. Considering Beijing\u2019s robust export footprint in uncrewed systems, the WL-X could could find similar success among customers interested in bolstering their maritime capabilities. \u201cThe Wing Loong family and CH-drone series have been sold to dozens of states; it is plausible to expect the new drone on the buying list of countries that cannot access or afford Western systems due to cost, export controls, or political constraints,\u201d Federico Borsari, resident fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said. At a 2024 exhibition in China, AVIC displayed a prototype of the drone armed with different maritime weapon systems, including underwing sonobuoy dispenser pods and electric-propulsion torpedoes. At the Singapore Airshow, while information was displayed regarding the physical capabilities and 24-meter wingspan of the WL-X, the manufacturer offered no information on payload options. Among the list of operators of the Chinese-made Wing Loong drone models are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Pakistan, Morocco, Algeria, Indonesia, and Nigeria. In 2024, the Royal Saudi Air Force reportedly reached a new milestone with its Wing Loong II fleet, logging 5,000 flight hours. According to Borsari, some of these countries could be potential recurring customers of the new variant, interested in integrating it to support their navies. The success of the WL-X will largely be contingent on its price tag, which is traditionally an area where China faces weaker competition from more expensive Western-made platforms. While China has been profitable in the combat drone sector, it has not seen the same success in the smaller market for fifth-generation fighter jets, even if the large-scale model of the J-35A here garnered attention from visitors here. A company representative declined to answer whether foreign buyers had expressed interest in the Chinese-built aircraft. According to Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at RAND, the Asian country will have a hard time marketing it in an already saturated market. \u201cThe industry is small for Beijing since many of the wealthiest countries that can afford fifth-generation airplanes are either allies with the U.S. or long-standing clients of Russia. \u2026 Only a few, such as Pakistan, have enduring security ties with China,\u201d Heath said.

                                    "description": "Lockheed Martin on Monday unveiled its Lamprey Multi\u2011Mission Autonomous Undersea Vehicle, an unmanned underwater vehicle that can attach itself to ships, launch torpedoes and deploy airborne drones. With a 24-foot payload bay, the Lamprey can be modified to perform a wide range of operations, from the seabed to the surface, according to the company. It can loiter on the ocean floor and recharge its batteries by attaching to a host ship, in addition to collecting intelligence from the ocean floor while offering a low stealth profile. Below the surface, the Lamprey can launch both antisubmarine torpedoes and decoys. At surface level, it can launch unmanned aerial vehicles into the air to conduct reconnaissance or deliver kinetic strikes. These capabilities enable the system to conduct antiship warfare both at surface level and underwater. \u201c[Lamprey] was internally funded, letting us iterate at lightning speed and hand the Navy a true multi-mission weapon that detects, disrupts, decoys and engages on its own,\u201d Paul Lemmo, vice president and general manager of sensors, effectors and mission systems at Lockheed Martin, said in a statement. Like many autonomous systems, the Lamprey can be deployed in swarms and communicate with other unmanned systems to perform missions. It also features advanced surveillance technology that it can deploy at surface level, the company said.

                                    "description": "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine has launched Mission Control, a first-of-its-kind digital command-and-control system designed to unify planning, execution and reporting for all drone operations across the country, as Kyiv seeks more innovative ways to move the frozen front line on the battlefield after almost four years of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. The new system sits inside DELTA, Ukraine\u2019s battlefield management ecosystem \u2014 an operational platform that already connects sensors and shooters across air, land, maritime, cyber, and space domains. Ukrainian drone crews enter operational data into the system, including drone type, launch location, flight route, and mission task, which generates reports on real battlefield activity, according to officials. The process is meant to eliminate paper reports, facilitating an immediate analysis of battlefield conditions and strike effectiveness. Mission Control represents Kyiv\u2019s latest push to turn improvised war-fighting into a standardized, data-driven operation, echoing the sensor-to-shooter integration Western militaries have sought for decades. The rollout comes as Ukraine positions its wartime data trove as leverage in peace negotiations \u2014 and as a touchpoint for deeper integration with allies. \u201cWe will create a system that allows them to develop their software solutions utilizing our data,\u201d Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov told reporters days before launching Mission Control, per Reuters. \u201cCurrently, data from the front lines holds immense value.\u201d Although Fedorov announced the system\u2019s kickoff just last month, officials have been working on the concept for years as a means to level the playing field against Russia\u2019s military numerical overmatch, Ukraine, Deputy Defense Minister Lt. Col. Yuriy Myronenko told Military Times last week. \u201cWe are a very different country from our enemy,\u201d Myronenko said. \u201cThey have a lot of resources, people, money, and a lot of Soviet units, storage, ammunition, and a lot of things.\u201d Myronenko served as a combat commander fighting with drones in Ukraine\u2019s southern front in 2023, then led the DELTA development group, then oversaw national cyber defense and drone procurement before moving to his current post. His view, and his recent appointment as deputy minister after serving previously in the Ministry of Digital Transformation alongside Federov, reflects the ministry\u2019s broader bet that technology and speed are the country\u2019s top assets for offsetting Russia\u2019s advantages in manpower and materiel. \u201cWe have good software, and we like technology, we like markets,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only chance to win for us. There is no other chance.\u201d Ukraine now produces or procures more than 5 million drones annually, Myronenko confirmed to Military Times, including both \u201ckamikaze, one-time-use drones\u201d and fixed-wing drones reaching beyond 1,000 kilometers. Mission Control is designed to manage this arsenal across a front line stretching hundreds of kilometers. The advantage, Myronenko said, is not the technology itself \u2014 it\u2019s how fast Ukraine can identify what works and scale it before the enemy adapts. \u201cIf we receive technology, the enemy will receive it as well,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeed is key.\u201d Mission Control feeds directly into Ukraine\u2019s performance-based \u201cgamification\u201d model, where drone units earn points for verified kills and top performers get priority access to new equipment. The connection is automatic: data entered into Mission Control flows into the ePoints ranking system without requiring separate reporting, Myronenko said. \u201cIt is important for us to have a complete picture \u2014 with results and accumulated experience.\u201d Mission Control is designed to give commanders real-time visibility into what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. \u201cSome units use drones very efficiently, some of them don\u2019t, some of them have good management, some of them don\u2019t,\u201d Myronenko said. \u201cWe need to understand what is happening on the battlefield.\u201d The centralized system resolves that problem: \u201cComman",

The Pathway for Innovation and Technology is another office, yes, but its director says it will bring together the Army\u2019s innovation and rapid acquisition hubs at the service\u2019s headquarters level, putting muscle behind what until now have been siloed efforts, and coordinating them with the Program Acquisition Executives, who have the funding and authority to turn ideas into programs. \u201cI sit at the table with the PAEs. I communicate directly with them to express what we are seeing. I also serve as a tech scout for them,\u201d Col. Shermoan Daiyaan, PIT\u2019s director, told reporters Friday. \u201cWhat we've had is unit-driven innovation. We've had lab-driven innovation with [program managers] and PAEs. But in this case, the gloves are off and we can inject that capability.\u201d Within PIT sits the Army\u2019s FUZE program, Joint Innovation Outpost and Global Tactical Edge Directorate, who through Daiyaan now have a direct line to the acquisition offices. \u201cWhat I think is really interesting here is these divisions and corps have had these innovation hubs or labs for a while now, and they would find ideas, but there was no path to go take it to scale,\u201d said Chris Manning, the Army\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for research and technology. \u201cAnd so [members of the PIT organizations] are there on the ground and saying, \u2018Hey, what are the most promising things coming out of there? And how do I connect this to the broader acquisition enterprise?\u2019 \u201d One of the top issues they\u2019d like to tackle is power generation and integration, particularly for unmanned aerial systems, Daiyaan said. \u201cWith us doing multiple vendors of UAS, multiple vendors of different capabilities, they all may have a different battery,\u201d and it might be nice to have \u201cone charger to charge them all,\u201d he said. Ideally, a PIT-lead program development might look like an xTech competition to get a bunch of companies working on a problem the Army wants to solve, select maybe 10 companies and award them prize money, get their prototypes in the field with soldiers for a 30 or 45 days, and then award Small Business Innovation Research contracts for another six months of development. From there, they could use FUZE\u2019s Tech Maturation Program to buy five, then 20, then maybe 100 pieces of equipment, while working on a Program Objective Memorandum that would lay out a five-year acquisition plan. \u201cAll of that, in maybe a year now, we have moved the needle faster than we ever could, because we would have still been studying the problem\u201d under the Army\u2019s old acquisition model, Daiyaan said. He couldn\u2019t put a number on the number of different programs PIT is trying to get off the ground, he said, but there are hundreds. \u201cWe're 90 days in\u2014check back with us this time next year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe probably should talk about what we transitioned into programs.\u201d NEXT STORY: Move over, Best Ranger; the Army\u2019s looking for the best drone pilots Help us tailor content specifically for you: Thank you for subscribing!

This year, the service added Best Drone Warfighter. The inaugural battle kicked off Tuesday at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, bringing teams from across the active, Reserve, and National Guard components of the Army to test their skills and possibly win a slot on the service\u2019s drone competition team. \u201cAt the end of the day, it's not about receiving trophies or awards\u2014it is about \u2018what lessons can we take from this to find out who the best operator is and how they became the best operator? What skills and resources and training allowed them to become the best operator?\u2019\u201d Col. Nicholas Ryan, who leads the unmanned aerial systems team for the Aviation Transformation Integration Directorate at Fort Rucker, Alabama, told reporters. \u201cAnd who's doing some amazing innovation out there across the Army\u2026that we can then take and scale across the entire Army?\u201d The service is moving away from its previous drone operator model, which trained soldiers in its aviation branch to operate specific platforms. Instead, it\u2019s likely that soldiers with additional training in operating UAS will be integrated into infantry, armor and other frontline units, where new doctrine will have them working alongside machine gunners, Abrams tanks, and howitzers. \u201cAs we proliferate drones, and we're seeing where they best fit into the formation, what we're going through right now is deciding who are the right people to operate these, and what level of training do they need?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd this competition really helps pull that out. For this competition, we didn't specify what type of soldier\u2014what branch, [military occupational specialty] came here to do this\u2014it was just: \u2018Send your best UAS operators\u2019.\u201d The three-day meet included two different lanes, plus a separate innovation competition where soldiers could submit white papers and custom drone builds, or demonstrate their piloting skills. The Army is writing the book on using small drones in a tank formation Lightning Lab gives Pacific Army division drone-building capabilities on the front lines The first lane is a race through an obstacle course flying a first-person viewer drone. The second is a hunter-killer scenario, where soldiers camouflaged themselves with paint, dragged a weighted sled and did an overhead water-can press (events similar to the service\u2019s physical-fitness test), then had a half-hour to identify and fire at five high-value targets. \u201cThe first drone is the hunter drone, their reconnaissance drone, and it's looking at an array of targets\u2014about a company-size element of targets\u2014and trying to decide which one out of those are the most important targets. And then the other drone operator is carrying the killer drones, the smaller one-way lethal drones, but they're not kinetically lethal in this case. And then they have to use those to hit those targets.\u201d Ryan said that while soldiers have been able to execute the movements and operate their drones properly, there have been communication breakdowns as they worked to get into position, identify targets, and fire on them. \u201cThat's an example of something we didn't anticipate, but it's absolutely standing out as that is something we as an Army need to do better on,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we're going to proliferate these drones and want them to be more effective and lethal, we just need to improve on how our soldiers talk to each other to communicate when they're using them.\u201d Units were invited to bring their own small drones to the competition, with no strict rules about the brand, type or capabilities. That also meant they decided which and how much equipment to carry, something the Army is looking to standardize. \u201cWhen we're sending soldiers out to carry this equipment as part of a squad or a platoon, and they're carrying it in their rucksack, what is too much?\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHow many batteries?

                                    "description": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.\u2014After weeks of back-and-forth with AI company Anthropic, the Pentagon is actively talking with all four major U.S. AI players\u2014Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and xAI\u2014to ensure the companies and the Defense Department are at \"the same baseline\" regarding Pentagon expectations, the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering said Tuesday. \u201cWe actually signed contracts with all four of them over the summer without a lot of specificity,\u201d Emil Michael told a group of venture capital investors during an Amazon Web Services event. \u201cNow we want to deploy [them] on our system so other people can build agents and pilots, and deploy it,\u201d he said. In other words, after months of exercises and experiments, the Pentagon is looking to allow different command elements and business entities to build AI agents that can perform a wider variety of tasks with minimal human oversight. The discussions between Anthropic and the Pentagon have grown increasingly tense. Sources inside the company told Reuters the Defense Department was pushing to use Anthropic\u2019s AI models for domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons targeting, and Axios reported the Pentagon is \u201cclose\u201d to cutting ties with the company over Anthropic\u2019s refusal to give the Pentagon unrestricted access to its models. Some Pentagon officials, speaking anonymously, have even vowed to make Anthropic \u201cpay a price\u201d for its perceived lack of cooperation. Anthropic, which is heavily backed by AWS, is \u201chaving productive conversations, in good faith\u201d with the Pentagon, according to a company spokesperson. Michael struck a far more conciliatory note than other Pentagon officials who have spoken on the spat, and appeared at the event beside AWS Vice President of Worldwide Public Sector Dave Levy. However, Michael did not move from the Pentagon\u2019s red line. \u201cWe want all four of them,\u201d he said, describing OpenAI, Google, xAI, and Anthropic as America\u2019s \u201cAI champions\u201d with the financial staying power for long-term partnership. Still, Michael noted there are a wide variety of roles the companies might be able to play, and the Pentagon wants different business and command elements to determine what to do with the models, rather than have the companies tell the military what they can and cannot do. \u201cWe're wanting all four companies to hear the same principle, which is: we have to be able to use any model for all lawful use cases.\u201d Of the four companies the Pentagon has contracted with, Michael said Anthropic is the only holdout on the issue of their ethical safeguards versus the Pentagon\u2019s. \u201cSome of these companies have sort of different philosophies about what they want it to be used for it or not, but then selling to the Department of War. We do Department of War-like things.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s own safety or ethical safeguards must over-rule company safeguards, he said. He described an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d hypothetical in which the U.S. military could be using an AI agent that suddenly stopped functioning due to embedded company safeguards. \u201cThat\u2019s a risk I cannot take.\u201d The Pentagon has its own safeguards, a list of ethical principles enacted during the first Trump administration that governs everything from development to testing to deployment of AI systems. While the Pentagon\u2019s newest AI acceleration strategy questions the very meaning of \u201cresponsible AI,\u201d Michael said adherence to the AI ethics principles is still very much in place. \u201cThe good news/bad news about a hierarchical department is when there's a set of secretary-validated guidance directive memos that lays out the policies and procedures, people follow them. So that's not an issue.\u201d NEXT STORY: Initial Sentinel ICBM expected by early 2030, Air Force says Help us tailor content specifically for you: Thank you for subscribing!

                                    "description": "The troubled Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile program will hit a key milestone by year\u2019s end, with hopes to deliver the initial ICBM by the early 2030s, Pentagon and Air Force officials announced Tuesday. In 2024, the Northrop Grumman program to modernize the land-based arm of the nuclear triad went so far over budget that the Pentagon rescinded a 2020 decision to move the program into its engineering and manufacturing development phase. Program officials said in September 2025 that they hoped to re-enter that phase by mid-2027, but now say they plan to hit that milestone this year. \u201cLeveraging considerable progress over the last 12-18 months, program officials are executing a transformed acquisition strategy paving the way to complete the restructure and achieve a Milestone B decision by the end of 2026, while delivering an initial capability targeted for the early 2030s,\u201d the service said in a Tuesday news release. Air Force officials said successful ground tests, solid rocket motor qualifications, and critical design reviews are examples of much-needed progress since the program triggered a Nunn-McCurdy Act review in 2024. Additionally, service officials highlighted the new direct reporting portfolio manager role for critical major weapon systems\u2014which includes F-47, B-21, and Sentinel\u2014as crucial to accelerating the program. Gen. Dale White was confirmed for that position in December. \u201cThe DRPM has the direct authority to make decisions, informed by integrated inputs across the enterprise and in alignment with the mission priorities set by the Secretary of War and the Secretary for the Air Force,\u201d White said in the news release. \u201cThat construct allows us to resolve tradeoffs quickly and move with the speed required to deliver credible deterrence\u2014while preserving the discipline this mission demands.\u201d Sentinel ICBM program needs brand-new silos, Air Force says Air Force using Sentinel money to retrofit Qatar jet White\u2019s position, and the creation of his new direct reporting portfolio manager role that reports directly to Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg, appeared to be at odds with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s acquisitions reforms\u2014including changes to expand decision-making authority at lower levels. The new role \u201csignifies a major lack of confidence in the Air Force to pull off its main acquisition programs\u201d and allows White and the Pentagon to call the shots on Sentinel, said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI think it also signifies that there are certain programs that are too big or too important to fail,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of these processes it doesn't seem like are going to apply to these too-big-to-fail programs. Sentinel is definitely one of those, because we don't have an alternative. We don\u2019t have a fallback.\u201d Officials are planning for the first missile pad launch for Sentinel in 2027, the news release said. \u201cThe deliberate progress being made on Sentinel ensures that for decades to come, there will be no doubt in the minds of our adversaries about the credibility and readiness of our nation's nuclear deterrent,\u201d Navy Adm. Richard Correll, head of U.S. Strategic Command, said in the news release. \u201cThat is the ultimate deliverable.\" NEXT STORY: The Army is writing the book on using small drones in a tank formation Help us tailor content specifically for you: Thank you for subscribing!

At Fort Stewart, Georgia, soldiers in the 3rd Infantry Division are working on a pair of courses to certify soldiers to operate small unmanned aerial systems, part of a servicewide effort to create doctrine around using drones throughout every formation. \u201c3rd ID, specifically, is developing ways to qualify their operators on the different systems, and we are sending feedback back through the proper channels to big Army, to work on developing an Army-wide qualification course,\u201d Capt. William Langley, who leads the UAS and electronic warfare element in the 2nd Armored Brigade\u2019s 6th Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment, told reporters Tuesday. Both the 1st and 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Teams are participating in TiC, with a special focus on integrating drones into tank units, said Capt. Brenden Shutt, the division\u2019s innovation officer. \u201cThe legacy UAS systems were focused on dedicated 15-series UAS operators, whereas now, we're leaning more toward training standard infantry and armor soldiers to be the UAS operators,\u201d Shutt said. So far the division has been focusing on UAS classified in groups 1 and 2\u2014that is, under 55 pounds. They\u2019ve fielded more than 150 of them, Langley said, including the Anduril Ghost-X, Performance Drone Works C100, the Neros Archer, the Teal 2, and the AeroVironment Switchblade 600. \u201cWe mainly use these in a hunter-killer format, so we use the recon assets to find the targets, and then Archers\u2026to strike the target,\u201d Langley said. To qualify, soldiers start with about 40 hours of simulation training before ever touching the UAS itself. \u201cAfter that, we work with smaller [first-person view drones], and they have to hit some obstacle courses and hit some gates before they go to a larger FPV, where they then actually learn to fly them, and then put certain skills into practice and learn to integrate them into conventional armor/infantry tactics,\u201d Langley said. And rather than picking out a handful of soldiers to be the designated UAS operators, 3rd ID wants everyone to be familiar with flying a drone, in the way they are all qualified on their rifles. \u201cPreviously, it was very much a select group of people who were tasked with leveraging this technology to deliver effect,\u201d Shutt said. \u201cNow, every single soldier, from a maintainer to an infantryman to a signal soldier who fixes the radios\u2014all of them kind of have a baseline understanding of how drones work, and could, with the sim time, with a little bit of minimal field training, be able to deliver effects during an operational or training environment.\u201d Help us report on the future of national security.

                                    "description": "The Pentagon could further accelerate its technology purchasing if the services\u2019 emerging-tech budget requests flowed through the office of the defense undersecretary for research, the Government Accountability Office says in a new report. The report urges lawmakers to give \"budget certification authority\" for the services\u2019 research and engineering spending to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. \u201cThis would require the secretary of each military department and the head of each defense agency to transmit their department\u2019s or agency\u2019s proposed budget for research, development, test, and evaluation activities,\u201d the report says. The R&E office would then \u201creview each proposed budget and determine whether it is adequate.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the proposal was not well received by the services. \u201cThe Departments of the Army, Air Force, and Navy disagreed,\u201d arguing that the change would lead to \u201cdelays, restricted autonomy, and increased workload,\u201d the report said. But GAO says the current setup limits the Pentagon tech chief\u2019s ability to ensure that service purchases fit with broader plans for the joint force\u2014a \u201ckey role\u201d the office was intended to play. The Pentagon has already pushed through a variety of measures to speed up and coordinate technology efforts. A March memo prioritizes the purchase of existing \u201cdual-use\u201d technology, particularly software, over custom, service-built solutions. The Department also is pushing acquisition authority down to the tactical level, allowing colonels and Navy captains to buy equipment in small batches using other transaction authorities. These moves have met with approval from long-time Pentagon watchers like Paul Scharre, author of Four Battlegrounds and vice president of the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThis leadership team is very invested in shaking things up, moving faster, and clearing out some of the red tape,\u201d Scharre told Defense One in December. \u201cA big piece of this has to happen on Capitol Hill as well. Congress has to be supportive...that has to do with things like getting less control out of the appropriators and giving the Department of Defense more flexibility to spend money very fast and be flexible in how they move money around.\u201d The current draft of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, passed by the Senate in October, includes a provision that echoes the GAO\u2019s recommendation but stops short of full certification power. Instead, the Senate-passed bill would establish Portfolio Acquisition Executives, or PAEs, to replace traditional Program Executive Officers. These PAEs would have the ability to change requirements on their own and would grant the Pentagon\u2019s research office more direct authority over their activities. However, the House version of the bill is more cautious. It stipulates that these acquisition executives \u201cshall continue to report through their respective functional commands.\u201d This discrepancy remains a primary point of contention as the House and Senate move to reconcile their versions of the bill. Despite the friction, there is at least a philosophical agreement that the services must buy equipment that aligns with a broader joint-force strategy. The GAO report also included a pointed note for the Pentagon\u2019s tech leaders: the office \u201chas yet to ensure that Critical Technology Area roadmaps consistently provide sufficient information for military departments to invest in technologies for the joint fight.\u201d In other words: if the Pentagon is expected to follow a comprehensive tech strategy, the tech chief needs to finish writing it down.

                                    "description": "The Pentagon's new Science, Technology, and Innovation Board\u2014a merger of the decade-old Defense Innovation Board and the 70-year-old Defense Science Board\u2014is meant to \u201cstreamline\u201d the department's approach to the hardest technological and scientific national-security challenges. But it comes on the heels of Trump-administration cuts that could hinder those efforts. Streamlining is a persistent target for the Pentagon. But it\u2019s one that it has had trouble achieving in previous years, according to GAO reports, lawmakers, and military leaders across administrations. It is one reason why the so-called \u201cvalley of death,\u201d as in the chasm between a cutting-edge research program and an actual weapon getting into the hands of soldiers, remains a common complaint\u2014and one of the key reasons the Defense Innovation Board was created in the first place. The DIB, established in 2016, was a civilian body whose members had included tech and finance leaders such as Eric Schmidt, Michael Bloomberg, and Neil deGrasse Tyson. It aimed to bring thought leadership from top business leaders into the Pentagon. The board produced a wide variety of key recommendations that the Pentagon later adopted, such as moving to large-scale enterprise cloud computing and adopting a long list of ethics principles for the development, testing, deployment, and operation of artificial intelligence across the military. The Defense Science Board, meanwhile, largely produced reports for Congress and military leadership on specific Defense Department issues, such as how to reform testing and evaluation and bringing more digital engineering into the department. The new Science, Technology and Innovation Board, or STIB, includes defense science experts in areas such next-generation autonomy, testing, advanced hypersonics, and acquisition. It also includes private-sector experts in fields such as advanced neural networks. The new board emerges at a time when the military is keen to integrate artificial intelligence into more of what it does, reach new research breakthroughs more rapidly, and quickly produce large numbers of cheap, highly autonomous drones. One former senior defense official said the board should look at \u201call aspects of AI, from energy requirements, ethics, and direction of research,\u201d to \u201chow to accelerate the fusing of the massive amounts of all-domain sensory data the department has to train multimodal AI for offensive and defensive operations.\u201d However, they pointed out that the board is uniformly white and largely male. \u201cIt misses the mark as far as representation goes, thereby handicapping its credibility with the American public,\u201d they said. Another question is whether the new board will conduct public meetings, as the Defense Innovation Board did, or meet in private, like the Defense Science Board. The STIB announcement makes no mention either way, and a Pentagon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Monday. Shrinking the defense science, research, oversight footprint The new board is the latest in a series of Pentagon moves to merge offices or activities launched over the last decade and accelerate the adoption of AI, particularly dual-use AI from companies that also sell to the public. On January 12, the Pentagon announced an effort to accelerate the use of large foundation models such as Google\u2019s Gemini. They simultaneously announced an \u201coverhaul\u201d to more closely align offices like the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, the Strategic Capabilities Office, and the Defense Innovation Unit under the under secretary of defense for research and engineering. These moves align with what current and former military officials, government watchdogs, and lawmakers have long been urging Pentagon leaders to do: reform the way the department buys technology to be more like DIU. The reorganization of these offices and activities was taken by many observers across the political spectrum as a sign that Pentagon leadership had finally beg",

                                    "description": "A new \u201cnon-kinetic effects cell\u201d has helped push cyber operations to the forefront of specialized U.S. military missions such as the capture of Venezuela's leader in the capital of Caracas, a top official told lawmakers Wednesday. The cell is \u201cdesigned to integrate, coordinate and synchronize all of our non-kinetics into the planning, and then, of course, the execution of any operation globally,\u201d Joint Staff Deputy Director for Global Operations Brig. Gen. R. Ryan Messer told the Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s cybersecurity panel. Non-kinetic effects are military actions\u2014think cyber operations, electronic warfare and influence campaigns\u2014that influence or disrupt an adversary\u2019s systems without using physical force or causing direct destruction. The operation that apprehended Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro included cyber effects that targeted radar, internet, and the city\u2019s power grid, causing a temporary blackout. U.S. spy agencies stood up crisis action teams that provided intelligence to Special Operations Command and Southern Command throughout the operation, a U.S. official with knowledge of the matter has told Nextgov/FCW. The NSA oversaw geolocation support to gather intelligence that aided the operation and monitored other signals that help operators determine if a foreign adversary orders troop movements or seeks to activate radar, the official said. The cell is just part of the effort to better integrate cyber and other non-kinetic tools into U.S. military operations. \u201cThe reality is that we\u2019ve now pulled cyber operators to the forefront,\u201d Messer said. Other leaders talked about \u201cCyber Command 2.0,\u201d a two-month-old effort to increase the hiring and improve the retention of skilled military cyber specialists. A scaled-back version of a broader restructuring effort initially planned for the 15-year-old command, the approach focuses on better recruiting and managing cyber personnel across the armed forces, improving access to specialized training through partnerships with industry and universities, and speeding up the development of new cyber tools and techniques. \u201cOur intent as part of CyberCom 2.0 is, if you\u2019re a young person \u2014 a hacker \u2014 and you want to come serve your country, when you show up at your recruiting station, we want you to be administered a cyber aptitude test,\u201d said Lt. Gen. William Hartman, acting director of Cyber Command and the NSA. \u201cIf you score well on that test, we would like you to be offered a contract to become a cyber operator\u201d and enter a pipeline to join CyberCom. \u201cI would tell you not just Absolute Resolve, but Midnight Hammer and a number of other operations, we've really graduated to the point where we're treating a cyber capability just like we would a kinetic capability,\u201d Hartman added, referring respectively to the Venezuela operation and a U.S. bombing run last year that targeted key nuclear sites in Iran. Katie Sutton, the Pentagon\u2019s cyber policy chief, highlighted the CyberCom 2.0-backed Cyber Innovation Warfare Center, which is meant to quickly design and deploy various cyber tools, including new software and tactics used to disrupt adversary networks and defend U.S. military systems. The private sector would play a major role in this. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about acquiring a tool or a technology, there\u2019s a lot of non-material aspects that will need to be successful,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our tie to industry. It ties our operational force directly to industry to allow this to happen at the speed at which we\u2019re seeing the capabilities come out.\u201d The 2.0 model, initially endorsed during the Biden administration, then accelerated under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, albeit with various rewrites and examinations penned over the last year. Many of the initiatives in the 2.0 framework are expected to be fully integrated later this decade or in the early 2030s.

Combat effectiveness now requires building up \u201ca lot of the intrinsic motivators that soldiers may not necessarily have prioritized years ago when all we focused on was PT scores,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cIt's the ability to be cognitively present in what you're doing. And that's a very different beast.\u201d Hammond spoke at Human Performance Symposium, which gathered human-performance leaders and experts at this Georgia base long known as the home of the infantry and more recently as the center of Army training for maneuver\u2014the tactical movement of soldiers and equipment to gain an advantage over enemies. (The conference was organized by FBC, a corporate sister of Defense One.) Soldier performance, whether it's taking physical territory or working cyber or drone piloting missions, is at the heart of that activity, said Maj. Gen. Colin Tuley, who leads the Maneuver Center of Excellence. All future company and troop commanders, as well as about two-thirds of platoon leaders, come through Fort Benning for training. That\u2019s one reason why the fort is also the home to the Army\u2019s Holistic Health and Fitness Academy, which is to dramatically expand in the coming year. \u201cThis is going to be that headquarters for the Army [holistic health and fitness training]. I want to have that flagpole planted here by early summer,\u201d Tuley said. \u201cThe program will expand to a total of 111 brigades that include the additional human performance areas of support teams.\u201d Col. Jay Morgan, the holistic health and fitness director, laid out how individual soldier data on sleep and wellness will play a large role in that, in addition to traditional military fitness benchmarks. His team is working to incorporate soldier-borne devices into regular activity to provide a fuller data picture of how soldiers are actually feeling and performing, not just how well they\u2019re meeting physical requirements. \u201cWe'll move into a prototype phase over the next 45 days, beginning at the end of the month,\u201d Morgan said regarding a wearable device that meets security requirements. \u201cOur goal is to get out to the 101st [Airborne Division] early third quarter and begin to pilot this. Really, our litmus test is: Are soldiers using it?\u201d A spokesperson for Fort Benning emphasized that they don\u2019t yet know exactly how they will implement changes to holistic health and fitness training. However, new technologies like wearable biometric trackers and consumer-facing artificial intelligence are opening opportunities to understand how military operators will perform not just on physical tasks, but across the wide number of increasingly technological challenges that characterize modern warfare, said Hammond, who has worked with USSOCOM. But it\u2019s also a measurable beast, said Chris Myers, a researcher at the Air Force Research Lab who specializes in human performance. Much of Myers\u2019 work hinges on a fundamental rethinking of what military activity is in an age dominated by rapid technological innovation cycles and faster, data-fueled operations. In this reality, military performance should be treated not like athletic training, but more like the buying and maintaining of a complex weapon. \u201cWhen you start looking at our human beings as a human weapon system, you can start looking at it through a lens of acquisitions, which really has three different proponents: procurement, fueling and sustainment, and disposition,\u201d Myers said. \u201cSo basic training, feeding and nutrition, and actually monitoring the",

The department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy office is giving six teams up to $15 million to produce prototypes of manufacturable next-generation energy storage within two years. \u201cWe want to develop a system, a battery system or an energy system, that has four times the energy density of lithium ion batteries that we have today,\u201d said James Seaba, program director at Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E. If successful, the technology could enable military drones, robots, and aircraft of far greater capability and use. Scientists have long looked for ways to extend battery life, but the ARPA-E program aims to produce leapfrog tech within 24 months. The effort, dubbed the Jumpstart Opportunities to Unleash Leadership in Energy Storage with 1K Energy Storage Systems, or JOULES-1K, started 18 months ago with a baker\u2019s dozen of teams. Now, just six \u201cperformers\u201d will move into its second phase to develop working prototypes. In the $16.9-million Phase 1, teams \u201cproved out the chemistry, for example\u2026or parts of the system,\u201d Seaba said. Now, \u201cthey have to be able to deliver a system by the end of Phase 2 that we consider scalable.\u201d Batteries have become indispensable on the battlefield, powering troop-carried systems, drones, and more. But many are made of materials and components from China\u2014which is working on next-gen batteries of its own\u2014and so the Pentagon is seeking new energy-storage technologies that can be made closer to home. One of the JOULES-1K performers, Silicon Valley-based startup And Battery Aero, is getting around $4 million to prove out its high-energy battery tech, which is focused on the needs of drones. \u201cWe have multiple commercial drone partners with whom we're going to integrate our energy storage solution into. And then demonstrate this improved endurance, payload, range combination,\u201d Venkat Viswanathan, the company\u2019s founder and a University of Michigan aerospace engineering professor, told Defense One. Viswanathan said the company\u2019s approach increased energy density by about 25 percent in a previous ARPA-E program. \u201cWe had a chemistry innovation, we had a material science innovation, we scaled it up, and then we integrated that into a packaged energy storage solution, and then integrated it into drones,\u201d he said. The next two years will be about getting to that first flight. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like that first demonstration flight,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these kinds of scientific advances face scaling challenges. And we know that it's real. And so I think we have our work cut out for the next 24 months.\u201d Other teams competing hail from Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland \u2013 College Park, Illinois Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Connecticut-based Precision Combustion.

                                    "description": "The city of Baotou\u2014long the heart of the rare-earths mining sector that has given China a stranglehold over the modern economy\u2014is now working to establish entire next-generation production chains. In Inner Mongolia\u2019s second-largest city, processed ores flow quickly to factories that make magnets and motors, and onward to production lines that crank out drones, eVTOL aircraft, and even humanoid robots. The result is an industrial powerhouse that other Chinese cities are working to emulate\u2014and that U.S. firms are unable to match. Beijing views rare earths as not just merely a tool of global influence, but an ignition point for integrated industrial innovation. Their unique qualities enable the creation of magnets and motors that deliver more lift per watt and more torque per kilogram. Across China, local governments now co-locate rare-earth processing zones with component makers and drone and robotics parks, turning mineral hubs into full-stack ecosystems. In Sichuan Province, for example, the city of Mianyang is building on its reputation as a regional base of defense research and development with a major investment in permanent magnet construction. Such clusters reflect the government\u2019s push for \u201cnew quality productive forces\u201d: advanced industrial capacity built on secure inputs, dense supply chains, and fast scaling. Baotou shows the model in its most complete form. City plans lay out a network of bases to support UAV testing, training, and logistics. This effort is anchored by the Rare Earth High-Tech Zone, where the proximity of component makers and downstream integrators speeds iteration and reduces supply-chain friction. Local government messaging describes a full chain that runs from mining and magnet production to motor fabrication and UAV assembly. Several rare-earth cities are taking aim at a particular market sector: the \u201clow-altitude economy\u201d: products, services, and infrastructure to support activities in airspace below 1,000 meters (3,280 feet). Such activities include delivery, surveillance, tourism, and urban air transport. The Civil Aviation Administration of China expects the sector to be worth up to 2.5 trillion RMB (about $500 billion) within a decade. Already, logistics drones are flying routes that link the mountainous inland province of Jiangxi to major delivery networks serving the Pearl River Delta. In Jiangxi, the city of Ganzhou has built a permanent-magnet-motor park and connected it to a low-altitude-economy park that provides R&D, manufacturing, operations support, and regulatory frameworks. The aim is to create a municipal-scale ecosystem with local sources of magnets, motors, airframes, and operational support, reducing lead times and accelerating scaling. Another low-altitude ecosystem is rising in Fujian Province, Jiangxi\u2019s neighbor to the east. Chinese officials often sell the low-altitude economy as a boon to commerce and public services such as delivery, inspection, agriculture, and tourism. Defense-affiliated commentary and local armed forces activity, however, show how localities increasingly treat it as a dual-use resource for national defense. Some low-altitude-economy parks are now building defense capacity into their tenant mix, using their talent, platforms, and industrial capacity to aid in defense mobilization. One Sichuan park has created a pair of specialized militia units: a reconnaissance platoon built around long-range UAVs and a company that specializes in the rapid repair of airfields. In Jiangsu, a local People\u2019s Armed Forces Department has organized UAV-based reconnaissance units that have deployed for civilian missions such as disaster survey and water rescue\u2014but are organized for use in wartime. Such militia teams provide structures for training, tasking, and integration during crises. This arrangement narrows the gap between commercial capacity and organized wartime support by keeping platforms, operators, and maintenance ecosystems close to the mobilization system. And ",

                                    "description": "The U.S. military wants to make it easy for troops to direct swarms of drones\u2014on land, at sea, or in the air\u2014and is offering vendors up to $100 million to do so. On Tuesday, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Innovation Unit announced the Orchestrator Prize Challenge, the latest sign that the military is looking beyond simply buying warbots in bulk toward the larger challenge of giving commanders a way to command groups of different drones from different makers. \u201cWe want orchestrator technologies that allow humans to work the way they already command\u2013through plain language that expresses desired effects, constraints, timing, and priorities\u2014not by clicking through menus or programming behaviors,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Frank Donovan, who leads the Defense Autonomous Warfare Group. The DAWG, essentially a re-branding of the Replicator initiative, is running the challenge along with DIU and the Navy. Replicator sought to procure thousands of small, highly autonomous drones quickly but missed a key August goal for delivery. (The bar is set by Ukraine, which last year sent more than a million drones to its frontline units.) The Pentagon has been hacking away at bureaucratic obstacles that prevent the fast acquisition of drones, but the larger problem is how to make them actually useful to commanders who can\u2019t spare troops to operate one drone at a time, as Ukrainian units do. Hence the Ender\u2019s Game-like \u201cOrchestrator\u201d challenge, to find a \u201crobust, scalable and vehicle-agnostic capability for understanding, tasking and coordinating autonomous systems at the fleet level.\u201d The concept of swarm robotics goes back more than 30 years, to this 1995 paper. The Pentagon has been holding multiple-robot challenges, like the Navy\u2019s SWARM and LOCUST events, for more than a decade. But SWARM used about a dozen autonomous boats in very simple naval maneuvers, while LOCUST employed choreographed maneuvers. The challenge now is to integrate multiple drones capable of autonomous decision-making and to subordinate them to a human, or at least to human judgment (which is a closer reading of the actual Defense Department policy on lethal autonomous weapons). The end result may be the real test of how well humans and robotic swarms really understand each other.

                                    "title": "QUANTUM CAMERAS COULD REMAKE SPACE-BASED INTELLIGENCE",
                                    "description": "Can quantum physics enable better, cheaper, faster satellite photos? In a month or two, a startup will test a \u201cquantum camera\u201d for space-based imaging. If it works, it could slash the cost of missile defenses and give smaller NATO allies and partners spy-satellite capabilities that were once exclusive to major powers. Funded in part by NASA and DARPA, the Boston-based Diffraqtion is testing a radically different way to make images from photons. You might think that the cameras on the world\u2019s most expensive satellites are fundamentally different from what your grandfather used to take old movies. But whether using chemicals and paper or chargeable transistors on a circuit, the process of deriving images from the behavior of photons has changed little in more than a century. That is one reason why space-based image collection\u2014especially at high resolution\u2014is incredibly expensive. It\u2019s also why Johannes Galatsanos, Diffraqtion\u2019s co-founder and CEO, uses the term \u201cquantum camera\u201d rather than \u201cphotography.\u201d \u201cYou basically have light coming through a lens; it hits a sensor, and then that sensor takes a JPEG, an image, and then you can view it\u2026 or you can run AI on top, right, and detect things,\u201d Galatsanos said. \u201cWhether in space with high-resolution digital cameras or old-fashioned pinhole cameras, that process hasn\u2019t [changed].\u201d That traditional method limits what can effectively be photographed based on diffraction, the process by which light beams pass through an aperture. It\u2019s also a reason why high-resolution imaging satellites, like the WorldView-3, are large and heavy: like a telescope, they are mostly glass lenses and empty space. This is a reason why launches cost an average of about $50 million per satellite, and why why only a few countries have access to high-resolution satellite imagery. Quantum science opens the possibility of collecting images using sensors that don\u2019t require the same dense, heavy components. One of Diffraqtion\u2019s cameras is the size of a small suitcase, launchable for just half a million dollars.. That just might be the key to shooting down highly maneuverable hypersonic missiles, as envisioned by the White House\u2019s Golden Dome effort. The method proposed by Diffraqtion might lower the cost of the imaging systems on space-based interceptors, or even reduce the number needed to do the job. \u201cYou have more area coverage, you can look at more targets at the same time, and so on,\u201d said Galatsanos. The idea effectively reverses the process of deriving an image from photonic data. But in quantum science, the simple act of observing quantum behaviors changes them. That\u2019s useful for things like quantum encryption because it means that the message changes\u2014obviously so\u2014when intercepted. But it is also what makes quantum \u201cphotography\u201d impossible. Saikat Guha, another co-founder and the company\u2019s chief science officer, has spent several years describing a new method for deriving information from quantum behaviors related to light. This method does not \u201cobserve\u201d the photons in the traditional sense, nor does it act like a bed of capacitors or a sheet of film. Instead, it uses AI to model the optical field; so, rather than treating the scene as a blurry picture on a sensor, Guha\u2019s method treats the arriving light itself as the \u2018thing\u2019 to be measured via quantum mathematics. \u201cWhat we do is [take] light as it comes to us. The visible light coming\u2014we don't capture it, so there's no observation. But we transform the light, and at the end, when we have done the transformation, then we capture it. So we still retain the entire information of the photon as it traverses through the camera. And at the very, very end, we can observe the outcome of that processing,\u201d said Galatsanos. Galatsanos says that a wide constellation of quantum camera satellites won\u2019t be possible before 2030. But if the hypothesis proves out next month, it could change all aspects of space satellite imaging. NEXT STORY: Lightning Lab gives Pacific Army ",

                                    "description": "SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawaii\u2014The 25th Infantry Division is all about drones: Drones that sense. Drones that shoot. Drones that get blown to smithereens for HIMARS target-practice. And more and more, drones built by soldiers themselves. Tucked away in the converted storage room of a former movie theater, a handful of soldiers are producing drones by the dozen as part of the division\u2019s Lightning Lab, a 13-person unit borrowed from other parts of the division and rapidly trained to build drones, training aids and ad hoc solutions to problems encountered on the battlefield. The Lightning Lab troops also take their 3D printers on the road. When the division was deploying to the Philippines last summer, the unit was tasked with producing drones to use during the training, said Chief Warrant Officer 2 John Crutcher. They decided to produce a 3D-printed unibody frame they called the kestrel, so they \u201cwent out to the Philippines, made 125 of them out there in the field, and took a lot of good feedback from the field,\u201d including that soldiers needed to be able to fly the drones indoors, for training and room-clearing, Crutcher said. So, a week after they returned to Hawaii, they made a new model, dubbed the Falconette. The rapid\u2014some might even say \u201clightning-fast\u201d\u2014speed at which the lab can gather feedback and adapt is a key component of the U.S. Army\u2019s Transformation in Contact initiative, and a radical departure from the traditional yearslong defense acquisition process. Lt. Col. Eugene Miranda, spokesman for the 25th Infantry Division, said much of what the lab does is \u201csoldier-driven innovation from the point of need.\u201d \u201cA lot of that innovation is being powered down to the soldiers who are actually the users of the things. So we get that real-time feedback, versus these age-old systems where it\u2019s optimized only for the process of the planning, programming, budgeting and execution time horizon.\u201d How the Army\u2019s most tech-forward units are practicing for war In the Pacific, Army leaders expect today\u2019s fiction to be near-term reality In addition to the Kestrel and Falconette, the lab also makes one-way attack drones that cost just $12 in components to make, and is working with a company that won an Army innovation competition on swarm tech. The company brought its winning tech here and \u201cin 24 hours, we had redesigned our Kestrel frame to be able to fit their components to be able to get up and fly a swarm,\u201d Crutcher said. It\u2019s not just drones. During the Philippines trip, Crutcher said, they printed 110 new buttstocks for rifles, because the scopes were sitting too high to easily and comfortably use them with the original buttstocks. They also print training aids. So how much training do the soldiers need before they can build drones? Crutcher said his expertise came from \u201cYouTube University, Google University, Reddit University.\u201d One soldier who showed up on a Tuesday morning had built his first drone by the afternoon, and was building drones unsupervised by Thursday, he said. The lab also teaches other units how to use the printers and build drones, because \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be the single point of failure for the 25th ID,\u201d Crutcher said. \u201cYou can\u2019t rely on a 13-person shop to mass-manufacture at scale, right? Anybody who knows how to do math is going to be able to figure that out pretty quickly.\u201d NEXT STORY: Marine Corps picks industry team to create a robot wingman of its own Help us tailor content specifically for you: Thank you for subscribing!

Honeywell will adapt its design for its existing SkyShot 1600 engine to fit unmanned aircraft in the Air Force\u2019s Collaborate Combat Aircraft program as well as other uncrewed systems, according to a company statement. The SkyShot is a compact engine designed for use in autonomous aircraft. It delivers powerful thrust capability with either turbofan or turbojet propulsion. Turbofan distributes airflow more evenly and quietly, while turbojet is typically used for supersonic military jet engines and missiles. \u201cWe\u2019ve combined decades of proven technologies with the latest advancements to create an engine that can keep pace with cost, speed and performance demands of next-generation platforms,\u201d Dave Marinick, president of Engines and Power Systems at Honeywell, said in the statement. \u201cWe look forward to supporting the U.S. Air Force in the next phase of collaborative combat aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems propulsion efforts.\u201d The CCA aircraft are unmanned systems powered by jet engines that are designed to maneuver and fly alongside human pilots performing a variety of mission sets, including reconnaissance, air-to-ground and air-to-air combat. Last July, the Air Force carried out an exercise in which fighter pilots maneuvered two Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie drones in cohesion with an F-16C Fighting Falcon and an F-15 Strike Eagle. The U.S. Navy is also exploring CCA technology, awarding contracts to Anduril, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics, Boeing and Northrop Grumman to develop drone aircraft capable of being launched from aircraft carriers.

Arctic Specialist 26 offered an early look at what small, specialized teams can accomplish in the High North. These drills also help set the stage for the upcoming Cold Response 26, NATO\u2019s largest Arctic exercise of the year. The joint exercise, also called CORE 26, operates under NATO\u2019s new Arctic Sentry framework and is a major Norwegian-led, NATO-allied military drill held across the the region.

                                    "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared Tuesday that Russia has not \u201cbroken Ukrainians\u201d nor triumphed in its war, four years after an invasion that has severely tested the resolve of Kyiv and its allies and fueled European fears about the scale of Moscow\u2019s ambitions. In a show of support, more than a dozen senior European officials headed to the Ukrainian capital to mark the grim anniversary of the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people, upended life for millions of Ukrainians and created instability far beyond its borders. Zelenskyy said his country has withstood the onslaught by Russia\u2019s bigger and better equipped army, which over the past year of fighting captured just 0.79% of Ukraine\u2019s territory, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank. Russia now holds nearly 20% of Ukraine. \u201cLooking back at the beginning of the invasion and reflecting on today, we have every right to say: We have defended our independence, we have not lost our statehood,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin has \u201cnot achieved his goals.\u201d \u201cHe has not broken Ukrainians; he has not won this war,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Despite the show of defiance, Ukraine has struggled to hold off Russia\u2019s onslaught, and the war has brought widespread hardship for Ukrainian civilians. Russia\u2019s aerial attacks have devastated families and denied civilians power and running water. Putin made no mention of the anniversary nor did he say how the war was going when he spoke at a meeting in Moscow of top officials of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, on Tuesday. However, he told them that the threat of Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil has grown. Ukraine has increasingly deployed long-range drones that it has developed to strike oil refineries, fuel depots and military logistics hubs more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) inside Russia. As the war of attrition enters its fifth year, a U.S.-led diplomatic push to end the largest conflict on the continent since World War II appears no closer to finding compromises that might make a peace deal possible. Negotiations are stuck on what happens to the Donbas, eastern Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland that Russian forces mostly occupy but have failed to seize completely, and the terms of a postwar security arrangement that Kyiv is demanding to deter any future Russian invasion. The U.N. General Assembly called Tuesday for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, rejecting a different resolution proposed by the U.S. Washington supports an immediate ceasefire, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Tammy Bruce said before the vote, but opposed language in the approved resolution that stresses Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, because it would \u201cdistract\u201d from the peace talks. At a makeshift memorial in Kyiv\u2019s central square, where thousands of small flags and portraits show photos of fallen soldiers, Zelenskyy said he would like U.S. President Donald Trump to visit and witness for himself Ukrainian suffering. \u201cOnly then can one truly understand what this war is really about,\u201d Zelenskyy said. Trump, who once vowed to end the war in a day, has repeatedly changed his tone toward Putin and Zelenskyy over the past year: sometimes criticizing the Ukrainian leader\u2019s negotiating position while reaching out to the Russian leader and at others lashing out at Putin for heavy barrages and appearing more sympathetic to the Ukrainian predicament. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the invasion would continue in pursuit of Moscow\u2019s goals. They include a demand that Ukraine renounce its bid to join NATO, sharply cut its army and cede vast swaths of territory. Zelenskyy said he expected a fresh round of U.S.-brokered talks with Russia within the next 10 days. The number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides could reach 2 million by spring, with Russia sustaining the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since Wor",

                                    "description": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 As the United States assembles its greatest military firepower in decades in the Middle East, Iranians are warily awaiting the next round of talks with the U.S. in Geneva this week \u2014 negotiations that many see as a last chance for their ruling theocracy to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. Some say the situation feels hopeless. Battered by decades of sanctions, heightened by Trump\u2019s 2018 decision to withdraw from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers, Iranians also just suffered through the bloodiest crackdown on dissent in the country\u2019s modern history as security forces in January killed thousands of people and detained tens of thousands more. Now, as they await the outcome of the Geneva talks on Thursday, many fear the outbreak of a war that could surpass Iran\u2019s bloody 1980s conflict with Iraq. But while that conflict sparked a patriotic response from Iranian volunteers, the prospects of a war with the U.S. have riven a population that still includes hardline supporters of the country\u2019s theocracy as well as those who feel Iran is splitting at the seams. \u201cEvery morning when I get up, my brain is full of chaos,\u201d said Sepideh Bafarani, a 29-year-old woman who works in a woman\u2019s clothing store. \u201cIt\u2019s a possible war ... and an ongoing bad economic situation.\u201d Rasool Razzaghi, a 54-year-old resident in Tehran, the Iranian capital, summed up the approaching talks with a similar concern. \u201cI predict that if both sides really mean what they are saying, a war will start,\u201d he said. For weeks, Trump has talked about an \u201carmada\u201d that is now largely in place off the coast of Iran, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. He has also sent the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world\u2019s largest aircraft carrier, from the Caribbean toward the Mideast. Overall, there are at least 16 U.S. Navy ships assembled, according to an analysis by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. That\u2019s comparable to Operation Desert Fox in 1998, when American and British forces bombed Iraq for four days over Saddam Hussein\u2019s refusal to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions about weapons inspections. Between the carriers and aircraft on the ground in Jordan, there are also stealth F-35 fighters and other warplanes capable of launching a major attack on Iran. Meanwhile, the CIA published instructions in Farsi online on how Iranians can securely contact the spy agency. Iranians have been watching the buildup with growing concern, either by surreptitiously getting around internet restrictions or watching satellite news channels. Iranian state television has kept showing the country\u2019s military running drills and its leaders threatening massive retaliation against any American assault. Iranian state TV on Tuesday said the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guard held a drill that included launching missiles, flying drones and firing guns at targets along its coast, without elaborating on the exact time or place of the exercise. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not so optimistic,\u201d a passer-by told The Associated Press on Tuesday in Tehran, declining to give his name for fear of reprisals. \u201dIt\u2019s not an equal situation. One side has entered the talks with a lot of power, it has lot of equipment. On the other hand, Iran is in a weak position. They want total surrender, but I think that\u2019s not viable.\u201d Steve Witkoff, the billionaire friend of Trump now serving as his special Mideast envoy, has said the president didn\u2019t understand why Iran \u201chadn\u2019t capitulated\u201d given the forces arrayed against it in the region and beyond in Europe. Iranian Foreign Minister spokesman Esmail Baghaei dismissed Witkoff\u2019s comments on Monday, saying \u201cthe word \u2018capitulation\u2019 does not exist in the Iranians\u2019 dictionary.\u201d Even looking beyond the public statements, it remains unclear just what Iran could offer Trump. Tehran has insisted it wants to continue enriching uranium, something Trump has repeatedly said must stop. It also has refused to dis",

                                    "description": "PARIS \u2014 Russia\u2019s defense spending in 2025 rose at the slowest pace since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, impacted by financial reforms at the Ministry of Defence and a struggling economy in the face of Western sanctions, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Defense spending by Russia rose by 3% last year in real terms, after a 57% jump in 2024, according to the annual IISS Military Balance report published on Tuesday. Russia spent a record $186 billion on defense last year, compared with $44.4 billion for Ukraine, the IISS data showed. Russian defense spending could potentially fall this year from \u201ca very, very high point,\u201d said Fenella McGerthy, senior fellow for defense economics at the IISS, at a press briefing in London. After \u201csignificantly\u201d raising defense spending over the past four years, Russia now faces stagnating growth, a widening deficit and falling revenues due to Western sanctions, according to McGerthy. \u201cThere\u2019s been financial, fiscal reform throughout the Russian MoD in order to find efficiency savings to more effectively discharge spending,\u201d McGerthy said. \u201cBut also a recognition of that difficult economic environment and the inability to sustain such high levels of increases.\u201d Russia has tripled its defense spending since 2021, according to the think tank. Both Russia and Ukraine increased the share of their economy spent on defense in 2025 in their fourth year of war. Marginal territorial gains by Russia have come at the cost of heavy casualties, though the country has been able to sustain the size of its deployed forces, the IISS said. There is \u201clittle indication\u201d that Russia\u2019s ability to fight its war against Ukraine for a fifth year has diminished, and the country\u2019s threat to Europe is growing, IISS director-general Bastian Giegerich said. Russia suffered higher loss rates at the end of last year and into 2026, partly as it pursued a more aggressive offensive stance, according to Henry Boyd, IISS senior fellow for military capability. Should the trend continue, Russia will face pressure on its current operational posture, though the armed forces can scale back offensive activity as a counterbalance, he said. \u201cRussia does have as an ultimate fallback option the ability to conduct a wider mobilization of the Russian state and the Russian people, should it really, really feel the need to bolster personnel resources for this war,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, Russian loss rates tend to provoke a change in operational approach more than a kind of an abandonment of front-line operations altogether.\u201d Russia\u2019s defense spending amounted to 7.3% of gross domestic production in 2025, from 6.7% a year earlier, IISS data show. Ukraine dedicated 21% of its GDP to defense, from 15% a year earlier. European countries have been increasing their own defense spending in response to the perceived threat from Russia on NATO\u2019s eastern flank, with European NATO members on average spending 2.16% of GDP on defense last year, according to Giegerich. \u201cFurther spending growth in Europe will depend on sustained political and public support amid significant fiscal pressures,\u201d Giegerich said. \u201cFiscally constrained allies will struggle to meet the new target of 3.5% of GDP for core defense capabilities by 2035.\u201d Europe now accounts for 21% of global defense spending from 17% in 2022, with Germany and Poland accounting for much of the growth, according to the IISS report. Belgium, the Nordic countries and Spain also saw \u201csignificant budget uplifts\u201d in 2025. For Europe, addressing shortfalls in air and missile defense remains a priority, while limited industrial capabilities and challenges in scaling production continue to be constraints on European rearmament, according to the IISS. European countries have started to address some of the air-defense gaps, ordering $18 billion worth of short and very-short range air defense systems since 2022, compared to investments of ",

                                    "description": "The U.S. Air Force and Northrop Grumman have agreed to increase production capacity for the B-21 Raider stealth bomber by 25%, speeding up delivery of the service\u2019s next-generation long-range strike platform, the service announced in a Feb. 23 release. The deal applies $4.5 billion in funding previously authorized and appropriated under fiscal year 2025 reconciliation legislation, commonly known as the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill.\u201d The move accelerates the approved acquisition profile by increasing annual production capacity by 25%, compressing delivery timelines while maintaining cost and performance discipline. The B-21 Raider, built by Northrop Grumman, is currently in low-rate initial production, which began following a contract award in January 2024. Aircraft deliveries began on schedule in 2025, with the first operational aircraft on track to arrive at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, in 2027, according to the release. \u201cThe B-21 is foundational to our long-range strike capability and to credible deterrence,\u201d Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink said in the release. \u201cAccelerating production capacity now ensures we deliver operational capability to combatant commanders faster \u2014 strengthening our ability to outpace, deter, and, if necessary, defeat emerging threats. This is disciplined execution at the speed the security environment demands.\u201d The program\u2019s baseline acquisition profile has called for a gradual ramp-up in production, with an eventual full production rate of around seven aircraft per year, according to previously published estimates. The total planned procurement remains classified, though the Air Force has long targeted at least 100 aircraft to replace the aging B-1B Lancer and B-2 Spirit fleets over the coming decades. \u201cThis is what disciplined acquisition delivers,\u201d Gen. Dale R. White, director of Critical Major Weapon Systems and direct reporting portfolio manager to the deputy defense secretary, said in the release. \u201cThis decision reflects our confidence in the program\u2019s performance and the stability of the industrial base. By increasing production capacity now, we are responsibly accelerating delivery of a critical, combat-effective capability to the warfighter.\u201d The B-21 Raider is the Air Force\u2019s top acquisition priority for nuclear modernization and conventional long-range strike, designed to provide decisive advantages in complex battlespaces. The production expansion aligns with broader Defense Department efforts under Secretary Pete Hegseth to accelerate acquisition and field next-generation capabilities rapidly amid evolving threats. No new production rate or total fleet numbers were disclosed beyond the 25% capacity increase.",

                                    "description": "CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand \u2014 Submarines are among the most secretive of China\u2019s military assets, but a new class of nuclear-powered attack submarine \u2013 or SSN for short \u2013 has shown up in satellite imagery after recently moving to a launch bay at the Bohai Shipyard in Huludao. The new submarine\u2019s nomenclature is Type 09V, or also commonly referred to as the Type 095. Partially constructed, the boat could launch within the coming year. After the new submarine showed up in high-resolution satellite imagery, Naval News was first to report it on Feb. 12. Its estimated submerged displacement is 9,000-10,000 tons. Destined for the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), the incoming Type 09V platform is emblematic of China\u2019s extensive development efforts and a construction spree of nuclear-powered submarines. Rick Joe, an expert on the Chinese military, estimates the sea service currently has in service the following SSNs: one to two original Type 091 SSNs if they have not already been retired, plus two Type 09III, four Type 09IIIA and two to three Type 09IIIB attack submarines. Joe surmises another 5-6 Type 09IIIB SSNs are being fitted out or are undergoing sea trials. This amounts to three new SSNs being launched annually, compared to a rate of 1.1 to 1.3 boats per year in the United States. As for nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), the analyst assesses the PLAN has six Type 09IV boats and possibly another one or two being fitted out after being launched in recent years. Asked to assess the new SSN, Joe noted it is wider than the preceding Type 09III family at around 40 feet (12m) versus 36 feet (11m). He also listed new likely innovations such as X-shaped rudders, hull-mounted and retractable diving planes to improve speed and agility, and a pumpjet propulsor. The boat is also rumored to be the first Chinese submarine without a double hull; instead it might use either a single or hybrid hull. The 09V, measuring approximately 360 feet (110m) long, has universal vertical launch system (VLS) cells \u2013 estimated to be eight in number. Like the latest American Virginia-class SSNs, each cell is thought to contain all-up round canisters, containing perhaps three missiles each in China\u2019s case. It is difficult to say when the first Type 09V will enter service, but it could be as far away as 2029 after fitting out and extensive sea trials. China often builds two submarines of a new type before commencing series production, to allow problems to be ironed out. That timing suggests construction of the incumbent Type 09IIIB will continue into the early 2030s. The U.S. Navy holds an advantage over China when it comes to submarine technologies and anti-submarine warfare. However, as the Type 09V demonstrates, Beijing is working hard to close this gap. China has sufficient production capacity at Bohai Shipyard. Its Eastern Assembly Hall has space for twelve assembly slots measuring 144m long, while the newer Southern Assembly Hall has eight assembly slots measuring 157.5m long. In theory, these halls could simultaneously accommodate construction of 20 SSN-sized boats. China\u2019s next-generation Type 09VI SSBN is expected to take a number of technologies from the latest SSN as well. One new anti-ship missile that could potentially arm the Type 09V is the YJ-19 hypersonic missile unveiled at China\u2019s military parade in September 2025. Joe described the hypersonic YJ-19 as an \u201cair-breathing scramjet cruise missile sized for submarine torpedo tubes (553mm). It certainly is likely to offer quite a boost in anti-surface strike capability, especially as they don\u2019t have to be launched via VLS, but can in theory be launched from any submarine with torpedo tubes and adequate integration with the combat management system.\u201d This month, the PLAN revealed that it had accepted the YJ-19 for service on its Type 039B conventional submarines. This makes China the first country in the world to arm diesel-electric submarines with hypersonic weapons. Gordon Ar",

                                    "description": "It is the greatest concentration of American airpower in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 assembled to prepare for possible military strikes on Iran, even as diplomacy continues. Two carrier strike groups are converging on the region. Fighter squadrons are flowing into bases from Jordan to Qatar, bridged across the Atlantic by aerial refueling. Submarines and destroyers armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles patrol nearby waters. Patriot and THAAD batteries have been rushed forward. B-2 stealth bombers stand ready in Missouri. Now consider how long it has taken to assemble. The buildup began in late January. The full force will not be in place until mid-March. This is six to seven weeks to assemble a force capable of imposing meaningful costs on Iran. The reason is simple: aircraft fly, but mass sails. When commanders needed more airpower, they drew on the joint force \u2014 two carrier air wings, surface ships, Army interceptors, and sixty-plus land-based strike aircraft sent to Jordan \u2014 proving that airpower is bigger than the Air Force. Some analysts will see this surge as proof the United States needs a larger Air Force. They misdiagnose the problem. Airpower is not the same as the Air Force, and the pursuit of ever more exquisite aircraft has left the service less relevant to the airpower mission it claims to own. Air denial increasingly falls to the Army, electronic warfare to the Navy, and persistent strike capacity to ships and submarines. Consider each service\u2019s contribution. Air control remains the Air Force\u2019s core mission \u2014 but it is increasingly a joint effort. In the event of Iranian retaliation, air control means air denial, defeating the ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and long-range drones Iran is most likely to fire. That mission runs primarily through Army Patriot and THAAD batteries, backed by Navy destroyers. Air Force fighters play a supporting role, intercepting drones and slower missiles first, reducing the volume that surface-based interceptors must engage. That is not the offense-first, air-superiority mission the Air Force prizes. It is a layered defensive fight in which the Air Force is one layer among several \u2014 and not necessarily the most important one. Electronic warfare (EW) tells a similar story. The most capable tactical EW platform in the joint inventory is the Navy\u2019s EA-18G Growler. Six of them operate from Jordan alongside Air Force Wild Weasel F-16CJs armed with high-speed anti-radiation (HARM) missiles and Angry Kitten jamming pods. The F-35 still lacks a fully integrated anti-radiation missile like the AGM-88 HARM or its successor. If Washington strikes Iran, destroying Iranian radar sites depends on a Navy platform. Electronic warfare was once an Air Force strength. The Navy now leads its most critical element. Exquisite platforms buy exquisite capability for a narrow target set. They do not buy persistence \u2014 and persistence is what strategically effective airpower requires. Punishment, as Thomas Schelling argued, depends on the credible threat of continuing pain. What compels an adversary is not a single devastating blow, but the belief that costs will keep coming. Denial aims to degrade capabilities and foreclose retaliation. Both require sustained presence over time, which in turn demands mass. Washington should have learned this lesson from the last strike on Iran. After a long planning and buildup period, the single night of B-2 strikes last June damaged facilities Iran had spent years building. Months later, however, the United States is assembling its largest regional military force since 2003 to re-engage. The parallel to the no-fly zone over Iraq in the 1990s is hard to ignore: Episodic airpower, while tactically impressive, is strategically inconclusive. Strategic effects require sustained pressure, persistent presence, and continuous operations that force an adversary to make acute choices rather than simply absorb a blow and wait. The gaps this buildup exposes a",

                                    "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said he would deploy a hospital ship to Greenland, alleging that many people there are sick and not receiving care, even though both of the U.S. Navy\u2019s hospital ships are currently docked at a shipyard in Alabama. Trump\u2019s announcement prompted a defense on Sunday of Denmark and Greenland\u2019s health care system from their leaders, and it was the latest point of friction with the American leader who has frequently talked about seizing the massive Arctic territory. \u201cIt\u2019s a no thank you from here,\u201d said Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen. Trump\u2019s social media post about a hospital ship came after Denmark\u2019s military said its arctic command forces on Saturday evacuated a crew member of a U.S. submarine off the coast of Greenland for urgent medical treatment. The Danish Joint Arctic Command, on its Facebook page, said the crew member was evacuated some 7 nautical miles (8 miles; 13 kilometers) off Nuuk \u2014 the capital of the vast, ice-covered territory \u2014 and transferred to a hospital in the city. The crew member was retrieved by a Danish Seahawk helicopter that had been deployed on an inspection ship. Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday night, referred to his special envoy for Greenland and said, \u201cWorking with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It\u2019s on the way!!!\u201d \u201cWe have a public health care system where treatment is free for citizens. That is a deliberate choice \u2014 and a fundamental part of our society,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cThat is not how it works in the USA, where it costs money to see a doctor.\u201d He added, in a note of exasperation, that Greenland is always open to dialogue and cooperation. \u201cBut please talk to us instead of just making more or less random statements on social media,\u201d he said. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, speaking to public broadcaster DR, said Danish authorities had not been informed that the U.S. ship was on its way. The Pentagon referred questions about the status of the U.S. Navy\u2019s two hospital ships, the USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort, to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to repeated requests for more information. Both ships are currently at a shipyard in Mobile, Ala., according to social media posts from the shipyard, which also posted photos of them next to each other. When asked about the status of the ships and the president\u2019s post, the Navy referred questions to the White House. The historically strong bilateral ties after World War II between NATO allies Denmark and the United States have come under severe strain in recent months as Trump ratcheted up talk of a possible U.S. takeover of the mineral-rich and strategically located Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen defended Denmark\u2019s health care system on Sunday, writing on Facebook that she was \u201chappy to live in a country where there is free and equal access to health for all. Where it\u2019s not insurances and wealth that determine whether you get proper treatment.\u201d \u201cYou have the same approach in Greenland,\u201d she said, before adding: \u201cHappy Sunday to you all\u201d in front of a blushing, smiling emoji. Aaja Chemnitz, one of the two Greenlandic politicians in the Danish parliament, wrote on Facebook that \u201cDonald Trump wants to send a poorly maintained hospital ship to Greenland. It seems rather desperate and does not contribute to the permanent and sustainable strengthening of the health care system that we need.\u201d \u201cAnother day. Another crazy news story,\u201d she wrote in front of a smiley face emoji. Associated Press writer Michelle L. Price in Washington contributed to this story.",

                                    "description": "The U.S. Air Force and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. recently completed a successful manned-unmanned teamed demonstration between an F-22 Raptor and an MQ-20 Avenger unmanned aircraft, advancing the integration of autonomous systems into tactical fighter operations, according to a Feb. 23 company release. The live-flight exercise, conducted at Edwards Air Force Base in California, featured a human-piloted F-22 issuing real-time commands to the MQ-20 via advanced autonomy software and a tactical data link. The Avenger drone responded by executing a range of mission tasks, including waypoint navigation, combat air patrol patterns and simulated engagement of airborne threats, functioning as a direct force extender for the manned platform, according to the release. The demonstration leveraged government-provided reference autonomy software on the F-22 and GA-ASI\u2019s Autonodyne Bashi Pilot Vehicle Interface aboard the MQ-20. Onboard sensors enabled the unmanned aircraft to process information independently, coordinate maneuvers and exchange tactical messages with the Raptor in a continuous command loop between the two aircraft. \u201cWe appreciate the flawless execution of this mission using the government\u2019s advanced autonomous systems,\u201d said General Atomics President David R. Alexander. \u201cThis demo featured the integration of mission elements and the ability of autonomy to utilize onboard sensors to make independent decisions and execute commands from the F-22.\u201d The demo, meanwhile, builds on General Atomics\u2019 accelerating timeline for the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. On Feb. 12, the Air Force announced validation of the Autonomy Government Reference Architecture, or A-GRA, across multiple vendors. This included successful integration of Collins Aerospace\u2019s Sidekick software on the General Atomics YFQ-42A CCA for its first semi-autonomous airborne mission. The YFQ-42A, officially nicknamed \u201cDark Merlin\u201d in a separate press release on Feb. 23, executed precise commands for more than four hours under ground operator control, validating reliable data exchange and autonomy execution that support advanced manned-unmanned teaming, such as the recent MQ-20/F-22 demo. The Edwards demonstration is the latest in a series of tests underscoring the Air Force\u2019s priority on pairing fifth-generation fighters with autonomous unmanned aircraft. Such teaming concepts aim to boost lethality, extend sensor reach and enhance survivability in contested environments by enabling pilots to delegate tactical tasks to drones while retaining command authority for complex decisions.",

                                    "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. \u2014 The conclusion of the Army\u2019s inaugural Best Drone Warfighter Competition saw soldiers awarded in Best Operator, Best Innovation and Best Tactical Squad categories. On hand to present awards to the winners, who were selected from more than 200 competitors during the Feb. 17-19 event, were Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and Maj. Gen. Clair A. Gill, commanding general of the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence. Driscoll, who flew to the Huntsville, Alabama, ceremony after participating in Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Geneva, Switzerland, spoke to Military Times about the significance of the event and how it will inform the future of drone warfare and the scaling of unmanned systems. In remarks shared ahead of the ceremony, Driscoll told Military Times that he hopes the Army will be in position to buy one million drones within the next 18 to 24 months. \u201cA lot of what we\u2019ve been spending the last year doing is reorienting a lot of our systems so that a drone is not thought of as a piece of equipment that a soldier will have to sign out of an arms room and return, but more like an ammunition or a round that you take to a range,\u201d he said. Asked about his near-term goals for scaling drone production, Driscoll said the Army is currently focusing on assessing new drone technology for design and potential use. \u201cI think our near-term goals are more qualitative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as an Army have got to figure out how to reset how we think about purchasing things like drones, how we think about training on things like drones and how we think about repairing them on the edge.\u201d Driscoll maintained that there is no time to waste when it comes to building drones and integrating them throughout the force. The existing ability of adversarial nations to build and deploy unmanned systems makes that evolution paramount, he said. \u201cWe know if we look at our threats around the world, like in China or other nations that are producing 5 million to 15 million drones, we are short of that in both our commercial and military sector,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we need to get to a place where we can scale quickly to match them.\u201d Driscoll and Gill told Military Times that the Army is planning to launch a drone marketplace next month, which will allow private industry to market and sell drone innovations throughout the service. Products will be rated and reviewed, with increased competition expected to drive prices down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to allow the consumers \u2014 that\u2019s our soldiers and our units \u2014 to rate the equipment that\u2019s being sold there,\u201d Gill said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to allow for a natural free market economy to drive the best product.\u201d Driscoll said that the combined efforts of soldiers and private industry, in addition to the efforts of lawmakers, will help the Army meet its goals to increase manufacturing. \u201cI think the urgency is there,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cIf you talk to members of Congress, whether it\u2019s a defense prime or a startup, everyone knows we have to solve this problem. If you go speak to any of these soldiers out here, the talent and the innovation is there.\u201d The Army secretary added that the military\u2019s sense of urgency has ramped up due to the rapid surge of threats unmanned systems pose to national security. \u201cWhat keeps me up at night is just the sheer magnitude of the problem that is required and the concept of these layered defenses,\u201d Driscoll said. \u201cThe biggest thing that we in the United States Army and as federal officials and Americans face, the biggest dilemma, is how broad of the threat exists and how you layer in solutions that can take into account how much territory is required to be defended.\u201d Driscoll and Gill presented award plaques to the winning soldiers, including a team assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment that took home the prize for Best Tactical Squad. Meanwhile, 1st Sgt. Javon Purchner earned the title of Best Operator for his drone racing skills, and the Army National Guard\u2019s 28th Infantry Division clinched the award for Best",

                                    "description": "MILAN \u2014 Armed with a fresh defense-cooperation agreement, Denmark and Canada stand to exploit their shared use of MQ-9B drones as a practical touchpoint for Arctic surveillance, according to issue experts. The Danish Air Force officially established Squadron 729 on Feb. 16, which will operate the four MQ-9B long-range unmanned aircraft out of Aalborg Air Base, located in northern Denmark, starting from 2028. Earlier this month, Canada, which has acquired 11 of the same General Atomics-made drones that it will receive around the same time, signed a defense cooperation agreement with Denmark at the Munich Security Conference. The systems are planned to be based in different locations, including Nova Scotia on the east coast and British Columbia on the Canadian west coast. The team-up brings together two Arctic nations that have repeatedly drawn the ire of Donald Trump since he assumed his second term as U.S. president in early 2025. Trump harbors a grudge against Canada for not wanting to be part of the United States, and against Denmark for having no interest in giving him the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland. The defense-technical nexus around the MQ-9B drone holds promise in forging a closer connection between Ottawa and Copenhagen, as there is currently no formal maintenance-sharing or data-sharing arrangement between the two nations, according to issue experts. \u201cA joint logistics or maintenance hub would absolutely be strategically beneficial for them \u2013 maintaining equipment and operating bases in the region is very expensive \u2013 sharing facilities and having an integrated logistics system can make operations easier and more efficient for all parties involved,\u201d Jens Marquard S\u00f8rensen, director of a Danish consulting company, said. Still, both countries must first evaluate whether their operational plans match up. For example, basing the Danish fleet at Aalborg Air Base would colocate the equipment with air force maintenance expertise there, but it\u2019s a long way from strategic patrol points in Greenland, said S\u00f8rensen. \u201cThe long distances [from Aalborg] to Greenland may pose operational challenges \u2013 flight times are long, increasing wear on drones before they arrive for a mission, and they would lose fuel going there. \u2026 It also means that any kind of rapid reaction using the MQ-9Bs is not possible, so having a forward operating station in the Arctic itself would be a notable advantage,\u201d he said. To put this into perspective, the straight-line distance between the Danish air base and Nuuk is approximately 3,324 kilometres (2,065 miles), and commercial jets covering the same route average flight times of about four to five hours. Rune Raunow, a defense consultant at the Copenhagen-based Rethink Advisory, which advises the Danish Armed Forces, said a Denmark-Canada pact around the U.S.-made surveillance drones would be especially relevant for contingency plans, refueling or emergency landings. Cooperation on sensors, too, could factor into the equation, Raunow said. While the Canadian government has opted for L3 Harris Wescam MX-20D sensor systems for intelligence and surveillance missions, Denmark has not publicly disclosed its preference. \u201cThe drones are essentially just a platform; what will be more relevant is whether they will buy the same set of communication networks, sensors, optic detection systems, etc. \u2026 Being able to track threats in these very remote places would be extremely easier if they were using the same equipment,\u201d Raunow said. Canada\u2019s MQ-9B purchase was driven by its need to bolster Arctic operations and provide continuous intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, according to government statements. While stationing its fleet in southern bases is consistent with existing airfields and maintenance infrastructure, these areas are still far from the high Arctic and other regional chokepoints, where the country has increased monitoring needs. S\u00f8rensen suggests that if NATO was to re-open the Keflav\u00ed",

                                    "description": "BERLIN \u2014 Bulgaria\u2019s Sofia International Airport briefly suspended civilian air operations twice over the weekend while a fleet of American military aircraft staged at the facility, fueling speculation that Washington is positioning forces ahead of a potential strike on Iran. A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), verified by the Bulgarian investigative outlet Obektivno.BG, showed the airport restricted non-military operations on Feb. 23 from 01:15 to 02:50 local time and again on Feb. 24 from 01:05 to 03:35. Commercial flights are not ordinarily scheduled during this time frame. Airport authorities attributed the brief closures to routine runway repairs and explicitly denied any link to the American military presence. Photographs circulating on social media showed at least six KC-135 Stratotanker refueling aircraft from the 6th Air Refueling Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, along with C-17 and C-130 cargo planes and Boeing 747s typically used for troop transport, parked at the airport\u2019s Terminal 1, according to Obektivno.BG. Bulgaria\u2019s Ministry of Defense confirmed the U.S. Air Force presence, describing the deployment as support for \u201ctraining related to NATO\u2019s enhanced vigilance activities,\u201d with American personnel engaged solely in aircraft maintenance. Caretaker Foreign Minister Nadezhda Neynsky acknowledged her ministry had limited information and had ordered officials to collect additional details. The Sofia staging is a small part of a much larger American military mobilization. The Bulgarian investigative journalists have tracked more than 120 U.S. Air Force aircraft that crossed the Atlantic within days, including four dozen F-16s, three squadrons of F-35A stealth fighters, and 12 F-22 Raptors. Similar deployments, including F-22s staged at RAF Lakenheath, preceded last June\u2019s Operation Midnight Hammer strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group is also en route to join the USS Abraham Lincoln, which is already positioned in the Arabian Sea. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has refused to grant Washington permission to use two critical British-controlled installations \u2212 RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire, the European forward base for U.S. heavy bombers including the B-2 and B-52, and the joint US-UK facility at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean \u2212 for any potential strike on Iran, The Times of London reported. The buildup coincides with high-stakes nuclear diplomacy. American President Donald Trump, speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace on Feb. 19, said he had given Tehran roughly ten days to reach a nuclear agreement, warning that \u201cbad things will happen\u201d if talks collapse. U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met an Iranian delegation in Geneva last week, with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi describing agreement on a set of \u201cguiding principles,\u201d though significant gaps remain between the two sides. Bulgaria, a NATO member since 2004, maintains a Defense Cooperation Agreement with Washington signed in 2006 that permits U.S. forces to use Bulgarian military facilities.

                                    "description": "The alliance needs to close the drone gap with Russia in the High North \u2014 before it is too late. Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has accelerated the return of high-intensity competition to the High North, a region that was perceived as a peripheral corner of global geopolitics for much of the post\u2013Cold War era. As the United States and NATO Arctic allies hold intense debate about security throughout the region and begin to integrate drones for collective defense and deterrence, they face an uncomfortable reality: Russia is moving faster. A growing gap has emerged between the alliance\u2019s ambition to defend the High North and its ability to field Arctic-capable uncrewed systems at scale. The future of Arctic security will hinge not only on submarines, missiles, fighter jets and icebreakers, but on the capacity to deploy, sustain and counter uncrewed systems in extreme conditions and unprecedented numbers. In this specific competition, Russia can leverage a significant edge. It fields the world\u2019s largest industrial-scale drone ecosystem outside China and is institutionalizing combat lessons from Ukraine. Like Kyiv, Moscow has established a dedicated branch for uncrewed systems, expanded mass-training of drone operators, and is forming new drone units across the joint force, including within the Northern Fleet. It is also investing in Arctic-adapted platforms and command centers for long-range maritime drones. Annual production now exceeds 1.5 million units, with Western intelligence services expecting sharp increases driven by Chinese industrial support and sanctions evasion. In the Arctic, Russia is likely to use drones as integrated force multipliers: enabling persistent ISR along Arctic littorals and the Northern Sea Route, cueing Bastion coastal defense systems, supporting anti-submarine and anti-surface operations and conducting long-range strikes with one-way attack drones alongside traditional missiles. These activities will be tightly coupled with aggressive cyber and electronic warfare to degrade allied sensing, targeting and command-and-control capabilities. For NATO, uncrewed systems may matter more in the Arctic than in any other theater. Vast distances, sparse infrastructure and extreme weather constrain human presence and amplify gaps in domain awareness and response times. Traditional crewed platforms such as maritime patrol aircraft, submarines and ice-capable vessels remain essential but are limited in number and costly to sustain. Even with renewed investments, they cannot alone provide the persistent surveillance, logistics, and targeting required by NATO\u2019s regional defense plans. Drones help fill this gap. They can offer unmatched persistence, scalability, and flexibility at lower operational cost and risk to personnel, conducting a wide array of tasks, from reconnaissance and surveillance to logistic and resupply, casualty evacuation, mine and countermine operations, strike and more. In short, uncrewed systems are no longer niche enablers but indispensable elements for strengthening deterrence and defense in the Arctic. Procuring advanced platforms, however, does not automatically translate into usable capability. NATO faces structural challenges that limit its ability to exploit drones in the High North. First, most systems are not designed for Arctic conditions. Extreme cold degrades batteries, icing affects propulsion and sensors, communications become unreliable, and corrosion accelerates wear. As a result, NATO suffers from a shortage of uncrewed systems certified for sustained cold-weather operations. Second, infrastructure is sparse, complicating logistical support. Airfields, ports, and repair facilities are limited, while satellite coverage above 75\u00b0N is degraded and less reliable. Therefore, any robotization strategy must include adequate sustainment across the board. These challenges make reliance on autonomous features and GNSS-denied navigation essential, though the latter raises system co",

The Danish Joint Arctic Command, on its Facebook page, said the crew member was evacuated on Saturday, some 7 nautical miles, or about 8 miles, off Nuuk \u2014 the capital of the vast, ice-covered territory \u2014 and transferred to a hospital in the city. The crew member was retrieved by a Danish Seahawk helicopter that had been deployed on an inspection ship. Also late Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to deploy a hospital ship to the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland, alleging that many people there are sick and not receiving care \u2014 prompting a defense of Denmark\u2019s health care system from Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. \u201cWorking with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It\u2019s on the way!!!\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, referring to his special envoy for Greenland. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen, speaking to public broadcaster DR, said Danish authorities had not been informed that the ship was on its way. The historically strong bilateral ties after World War II between NATO allies Denmark and the United States have come under severe strain in recent months as Trump ratcheted up talk of a possible U.S. takeover of the mineral-rich and strategically located Arctic island. Frederiksen defended Denmark\u2019s health care system on Sunday, writing on Facebook that she was \u201chappy to live in a country where there is free and equal access to health for all. Where it\u2019s not insurances and wealth that determine whether you get proper treatment.\u201d \u201cYou have the same approach in Greenland,\u201d she said, before adding: \u201cHappy Sunday to you all\u201d in front of a blushing, smiling emoji. Aaja Chemnitz, one of the two Greenlandic politicians in the Danish parliament, wrote on Facebook: \u201cDonald Trump wants to send a poorly maintained hospital ship to Greenland.

                                    "description": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala. \u2014 Drones are profoundly changing the Army\u2019s approach to aviation and combined arms training, Maj. Gen. Clair A. Gill, commanding general of the U.S. Army Aviation Center of Excellence, told Military Times in an interview. During the Army\u2019s first annual Best Drone Warfighter Competition in Huntsville, Alabama, the Fort Rucker-based aviation chief shared his insights about the impact of drones on military doctrine. \u201cThe application of drone technology is only limited by your creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s this constantly evolving game of technology and craftsmanship to create the desired effect that you want on the other end.\u201d While Army aviators are no strangers to unmanned systems, drones being fielded today are immensely different from those developed over the last two decades, many of which tended to be larger and required more manpower to operate, Gill said. \u201cIn the last five to 10 years I would say we have seen a complete shift in what drone technology is and how it can be used,\u201d Gill said. The net result, he added, is that drones are \u201cno longer just the purview of Army aviation.\u201d \u201cI would argue now with the proliferation of small drones and how cheap and effective they can be that Army aviation is just one minor user now. ... Everybody is going to have drones in the airspace to some degree. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change everything. The nature of war is the same. It\u2019s always an endeavor of human conflict. But the character of war is just fundamentally different.\u201d Drones have been used successfully as a force multiplier in a variety of global conflicts, from Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan to the Middle East and Ukraine. While the U.S. Army is adapting its approaches based on observing other forces around the world, Gill stressed that there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to drone warfare. The U.S. Army must develop drone combat doctrine in line with its unique capabilities, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the Ukrainian army, nor are we the Russian army,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just fundamentally operate differently.\u201d Gill told Military Times that observers from the Army Aviation Center of Excellence are currently embedded with Ukraine\u2019s Security Assistance Group, or SAG-U, to study lessons from the conflict. However, fighting methods from Ukraine should not be broadly applied to American forces, he noted, due to differences in U.S. tactics and capabilities. \u201cWe would be fools not to pay attention and not to take a lot of lessons from them, which we\u2019re doing, but we can\u2019t take the wrong lessons,\u201d Gill said. \u201cJust because it didn\u2019t work in Russia-Ukraine doesn\u2019t mean it might not work for us.\u201d The tactical element of the Army\u2019s drone competition gave soldiers the chance to test drone aviation abilities while leveraging field skills on a hunter-killer mission, during which each team was afforded a single reconnaissance FPV drone and up to five \u201ckiller\u201d drones. \u201cThat really is the application of the technology,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThey have to be able to use the technology in the context of what it is that we do, not just fly the drone.\u201d The tactical challenge gave leadership an opportunity to observe with the aim of refining training, doctrine and approaches to drone combat operations. Gill explained that restructuring within Army commands has allowed analysis teams to be established at each Army Center of Excellence, including those dedicated to aviation, maneuver and fires. \u201cWe\u2019ve restructured our subordinate teams and we have something called a Transformation Integration Directorate, TID, and within them they have a Transformation Lesson Learned Manager, a TLLM,\u201d he explained. These managers are responsible for evaluating all observations and establishing what lessons are useful to the Army before uploading them into a new database system called Project Victor. Powered by generative AI technology, the system will give soldiers broad access to whitepapers, studies and useful information about operating drones in the field. \u201cThat should be a dat",

Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings.",

Across these datasets, DMCD achieves competitive or leading performance against diverse causal discovery baselines, with particularly large gains in recall and F1 score. Probing and ablation experiments suggest that these improvements arise from semantic reasoning over metadata rather than memorization of benchmark graphs. Overall, our results demonstrate that combining semantic priors with principled statistical verification yields a high-performing and practically effective approach to causal structure learning.",

However, conventional diffusion-based planning methods often fail to account for the fact that generating trajectories in RL requires unique consistency between transitions to ensure coherence in real environments. This oversight can result in considerable discrepancies between the generated trajectories and the underlying mechanisms of a real environment. To address this problem, we propose a novel diffusion-based planning method, termed as Diffusion Modulation via Environment Mechanism Modeling (DMEMM).

Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning.",

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io.",

Existing methods rely on rigid templates that simply concatenate fields, yielding suboptimal representations for recommendation. We propose a data-centric framework that learns verbalization for LLM-based recommendation. Using reinforcement learning, a verbalization agent transforms raw interaction histories into optimized textual contexts, with recommendation accuracy as the training signal. This agent learns to filter noise, incorporate relevant metadata, and reorganize information to improve downstream predictions. Experiments on a large-scale industrial streaming dataset show that learned verbalization delivers up to 93% relative improvement in discovery item recommendation accuracy over template-based baselines.

We introduce CausalReasoningBenchmark, a benchmark of 173 queries across 138 real-world datasets, curated from 85 peer-reviewed research papers and four widely-used causal-inference textbooks. For each query a system must produce (i) a structured identification specification that names the strategy, the treatment, outcome, and control variables, and all design-specific elements, and (ii) a point estimate with a standard error. By scoring these two components separately, our benchmark enables granular diagnosis: it distinguishes failures in causal reasoning from errors in numerical execution. Baseline results with a state-of-the-art LLM show that, while the model correctly identifies the high-level strategy in 84 % of cases, full identification-specification correctness drops to only 30 %, revealing that the bottleneck lies in the nuanced details of research design rather than in computation.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate.

Untrusted monitoring -- using one untrusted model to oversee another -- is one approach to reducing risk. Justifying the safety of an untrusted monitoring deployment is challenging because developers cannot safely deploy a misaligned model to test their protocol directly. In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies. We create a safety case sketch to clearly present our argument, explicitly state our assumptions, and highlight unsolved challenges. We identify conditions under which passive self-recognition could be a more effective collusion strategy than those studied previously.

In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.",

As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents.",

Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.\n  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.\n  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints.

We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals.

This principled approach allows us to track \"energy spills\" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization.

Past ``many-analyst\" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \\emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.",

To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.",

Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution.

                                    "description": "arXiv:2602.18884v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\\% to 75.70\\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .",

                                    "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lockheed Martin is stepping up its argument that the U.S. military\u2019s GPS constellation is becoming more resilient, even as military leaders warn publicly about rising jamming and spoofing threats and lawmakers debate alternatives to satellite-based positioning, navigation and timing. A series of upgrades in the next generation of satellites, known as GPS III Follow-On, or GPS IIIF, amount to a \u201cgame changer\u201d in addressing interference challenges, said Malik Musawwir, vice president of navigation systems at Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for GPS satellites operated by the U.S. Space Force. \u201cOnce we start introducing GPS IIIF satellites into the active constellation that we\u2019re operating today, we believe that that will change the landscape dramatically,\u201d Musawwir said Feb. 23 at a news conference in Aurora, Colorado, during the Air & Space Forces Association\u2019s Warfare Symposium. The comments come as GPS \u2014 long treated as foundational infrastructure for military and civilian users alike \u2014 is increasingly viewed as vulnerable to disruption. Jamming and spoofing incidents have proliferated in conflict zones and near sensitive borders, prompting calls for complementary or alternative forms of PNT, including other satellite constellations and terrestrial systems. The Space Force\u2019s current on-orbit modernization effort centers on GPS III. The service bought 10 of those satellites; nine have launched. They broadcast M-code, the military\u2019s encrypted GPS signal designed to provide more secure, jam-resistant PNT. An urgency to expand M-code coverage led the Space Force to accelerate launches of satellites 7, 8 and 9 and shift those missions from United Launch Alliance to SpaceX. GPS IIIF builds on that foundation. Under a 2018 contract that allows for up to 22 spacecraft, the Space Force has exercised options for 12 satellites, bringing the contract\u2019s value to $4.1 billion. The most recent satellites are priced at roughly $250 million each. The Pentagon did not request additional IIIF funding in its fiscal 2026 budget, but Congress added $528 million for two more satellites. The 12 satellites on order are in various stages of production, Musawwir said. Like GPS III, they will transmit M-code. They will also introduce new operational features, though they do not add new frequency bands beyond those already in use. The most significant addition is Regional Military Protection, or RMP. Earlier generations of GPS satellites broadcast signals in a wide pattern covering the visible Earth at modest power levels. GPS III increased that power compared with older Block IIF satellites. GPS IIIF goes further by allowing the satellite to focus its encrypted M-code energy into a specific region through a high-gain spot beam. By concentrating energy rather than distributing it globally, the satellite increases the effective signal strength seen by military users in that theater. A stronger signal forces an adversary to use more powerful and closer jammers to deny service. \u201cThat will dramatically change the calculus of how close, for example, jammers will have to be to the people that are trying to jam, the signal strength necessary to be able to provide a jamming signal that could thwart a GPS signal,\u201d Musawwir said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pretend to have clear, crystal clarity to what the future may bring,\u201d but he added that the new features \u201cwill make a huge difference.\u201d The satellites will also carry a search-and-rescue payload capable of detecting distress beacons from users on land, at sea or in the air and relaying their location to authorities. That capability is intended to reduce the time needed to locate people in distress. Beyond radio-frequency upgrades, Lockheed and the Space Force are exploring optical communications. The final GPS III satellite, number 10, will carry a Tesat-Spacecom SCOT80 optical terminal for a space-to-ground laser communications demonstration. The terminal can support data rates of up to about 100 gigabits pe",

He accused defense CEOs of caring \u201cmore about their stock options and golden parachutes than about delivering for the men and women on the front lines,\u201d and blamed the Washington establishment for outsourcing manufacturing jobs and weakening the industrial base. The remarks drew repeated applause from employees gathered on factory floors \u2014 a reaction that underscores how closely his critique mirrors frustrations common inside parts of the startup-driven space ecosystem. The Colorado visits are part of what the Pentagon describes as the \u201cArsenal of Freedom\u201d campaign, a cross-country push to highlight American manufacturing and companies investing in defense technology. The tour has included stops at Boeing, Lockheed Martin, SpaceX, Blue Origin and Rocket Lab, a mix of large primes and newer entrants. But at the commercially oriented firms, Hegseth\u2019s language gets particularly pointed. He described himself as engaged in an \u201congoing, never ending war of attrition against the Pentagon bureaucracy,\u201d adding: \u201cWe are in a war of attrition against our own bureaucracy for the next three years, and we intend to win it. We will outwork them every single day.\u201d At True Anomaly \u2014 a startup building maneuverable autonomous spacecraft designed for contested space operations \u2014 Hegseth said the United States \u201cquite literally can\u2019t deter that next conflict without companies like True Anomaly.\u201d While acknowledging that the traditional primes \u201ccreate a lot of wonderful, exquisite platforms,\u201d he warned that relying on \u201cfive companies that have the whole thing on lockdown\u201d would be a mistake. \u201cWe have to open the aperture,\u201d he said, arguing that smaller firms need a level playing field to compete. Sierra Space, which develops space systems for commercial, civil and national security customers, provided a similar backdrop. There, Hegseth again targeted what he described as a procurement culture that rewards delay and cost growth. \u201cNo more delays, no more allowing wealthy executives to line up their pockets with stock buybacks while the factory floor crumbles and our warriors wait for the tools that they need,\u201d he said. The rhetoric aligns with a broader procurement reform narrative inside the Pentagon. Senior officials have voiced dissatisfaction with cost overruns and slow fielding timelines in major defense programs and signaled greater interest in commercially funded innovation, fixed-price contracts and faster development cycles. Space \u2014 where venture-backed firms often tout Silicon Valley-style iteration \u2014 has become a focal point of that shift. \u201cOur goal is deterrence, so absolute that our adversaries tremble at the very thought of even challenging us, and space is the ultimate arena where that strength will be proven,\u201d Hegseth said. \u201cWhoever controls space controls the fight.\u201d He linked the role of private industry to the administration\u2019s Golden Dome missile defense initiative, which he described as a \u201crevolutionary shield of space based weapons and sensors\u201d built around next-generation satellites and space-based interceptors. The Pentagon, he said, will continue to seek partners that can \u201cdeliver the most advanced space infrastructure and deliver it fast \u2026 because we cannot afford to have a fair fight in space.\u201d The message re",

                                    "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 LambdaVision, a company that has used microgravity experiments on the International Space Station to develop an artificial retina, has booked space on a planned commercial successor. LambdaVision announced Feb. 24 that it reserved payload space on Starlab, the commercial space station under development by the Starlab Space joint venture. The company did not disclose the amount of payload space reserved or the value of the contract. Connecticut-based LambdaVision has worked for several years to develop artificial retinas, testing the production of protein thin films in microgravity through experiments flown on the ISS. The microgravity environment enables the creation of layers of thin films needed to produce the artificial retinas, which the company plans to test in patients with advanced retinitis pigmentosa. \u201cThis partnership with Starlab will allow us to continue to build on the significant momentum we have created toward our long- and short-term goals of leveraging LEO for both advancing our protein-based artificial retina toward commercialization and laying the groundwork for other potential commercial efforts in LEO,\u201d Nicole Wagner, chief executive of LambdaVision, said in a statement. The company raised a $7 million seed round in November led by Seven Seven Six and Aurelia Foundry Fund, with additional support from Seraphim Space. In an interview at the time, Wagner said most of that funding would go toward ground-based testing and clinical trials. However, she said the company planned additional ISS experiments and was evaluating options for future commercial stations or other platforms. LambdaVision\u2019s agreement with Starlab \u201cenables the transition from demonstration to scalable, sustainable manufacturing, unlocking exponential growth while delivering meaningful benefits to patients on Earth,\u201d said Luis Zea, chief scientist at Starlab Space, in the statement. The announcement comes as Starlab Space, a joint venture led by Voyager Technologies with participation from Airbus, Mitsubishi, MDA Space and other companies, refines the design of the station and competes for the next round of NASA\u2019s Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations, or CLD, program, which supports development of commercial successors to the ISS. Starlab Space announced Feb. 23 that it completed a commercial critical design review, or CCDR, for the station, one of the milestones in a funded NASA Space Act Agreement awarded under the first phase of the CLD program. The review confirmed the station\u2019s design is technically mature and executable, allowing the company to move into full-scale production. \u201cThis confirms Starlab is executable at scale and that our timeline aligns with ISS transition requirements,\u201d Marshall Smith, chief executive of Starlab Space, said in a statement. \u201cEqually important, our CCDR business plan review demonstrates that Starlab is being built around a real, diversified commercial market \u2014 one that supports sustained human presence and research in low Earth orbit.\u201d \u201cAs investors in both LambdaVision and Voyager, we\u2019re excited to see LambdaVision\u2019s innovative artificial retina technology combined with Voyager\u2019s Starlab platform,\u201d said Rob Desborough, a partner at Seraphim Space. \u201cTogether, they are demonstrating how orbital research can accelerate new therapies and expand the possibilities for commercial science in low Earth orbit.\u201d Jeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews.

                                    "description": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Sophia Space raised $10 million in seed funding to accelerate development of space-based edge computers and orbital data centers. \u201cThe $10 million round is a validation that we are progressing from slideware to hardware,\u201d Rob DeMillo, Sophia Space CEO and co-founder, told SpaceNews. \u201cAnd it\u2019s evidence that capital is shifting towards orbital-compute infrastructure.\u201d Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund and Unlock Venture Partners led the $10 million investment round. With the funds, Sophia Space will accelerate development of its orbital computing systems and proprietary thermal technology. The startup also is expanding its staff of engineers designing Tile, the technological building block of Sophia Space orbital data centers. Once the designs are completed, Sophia Space will produce demonstration Tiles for environmental testing, DeMillo said. Sophia Space, founded in 2023 in Pasadena, California, plans to establish a constellation of orbital data centers with the first operating in the 2030s. For the next several years, Sophia Space will sell Tile directly to customers seeking space-based edge computing. Tile is a compute module, measuring one meter by one meter by one centimeter, that contains four enterprise servers. The servers are arranged in a patented array designed for solar-power generation and passive cooling. \u201cSophia Space is delivering the kind of deep tech opportunity we look for, a space native platform solving the hard problems of thermal control, power efficiency, and reliability so AI inference and data processing can happen where the data is generated,\u201d J.D. Russell, Alpha Funds founder and CEO, said in a statement. Sophia Space, established in 2023 by retired NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory fellow Leon Alkalai, raised $3.5 million in pre-seed funding in 2025. That money helped the startup hire Jim Chase and other aerospace engineers from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory as well as software engineers with cloud-computing expertise. In a statement, Alkalai said Sophia Space\u2019s scalable supercomputing in orbit will fuel \u201cthe emerging space economy, strengthening national defense infrastructure\u201d and \u201csave lives on Earth by processing massive volumes of space-generated Earth-observation data in real time.\u201d DeMillo said in a statement that the seed funding enables Sophia Space to build \u201cthe infrastructure for the next era of space-based AI and data processing.\u201d Debra Werner is a correspondent for SpaceNews based in San Francisco.

In recent ground tests, Boeing engineers demonstrated that a large language model running on commercial off-the-shelf hardware could examine telemetry and report in natural language on the health of a satellite. \u201cIt speeds up the latency,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cWe were looking at being able to talk to our satellite in natural language and get a response back that made sense instead of just zeros and ones that had to be deciphered by ground software and engineers.\u201d Traditionally, satellites have sent telemetry to the ground for analysis. Increasingly, companies are developing edge computers for satellites and shielding terrestrial devices for space applications. \u201cYou want to do your compute as close to where you need it as possible,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cIn the case of a satellite, if you have information that needs to be calculated, you want it to be done as close to the device as possible and then send results down.\u201d Space-qualified devices, though, often lack the memory and power necessary for large language models. Because it can take years to space-qualify hardware, Boeing engineers modified a large language model to run on existing hardware. \u201cWe wanted to provide a path for our current constellations to enable processing of artificial intelligence models in space,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cWe proved in the lab that we could enable this capability with a software upgrade.\u201d Boeing Space Mission Systems AI Lab, formally established in 2025, is like an accelerator.

Then, we\u2019ll move fast, learn and iterate.\u201d Engineers in the AI Lab are testing ways to enhance satellite autonomy and simplify satellite operations. The AI models are grounded in physics to bolster safety and prevent hallucinations.

                                    "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Department of the Air Force Secretary Troy Meink said the U.S. Space Force is preparing for a period of sustained expansion as its mission set broadens and its workload increases, requiring both more personnel and a more specialized workforce. Speaking Feb. 23 at the Air & Space Forces Association\u2019s Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Meink said one immediate priority is expanding the Space Warfighting Analysis Center, or SWAC, the service\u2019s analytic arm responsible for force design and long-term architecture planning. How the future force is designed, Meink said, \u201cwill be critical as the Space Force expands even faster in the next few years.\u201d The Space Force, established in 2019 as the nation\u2019s sixth military branch, has roughly 10,000 uniformed Guardians and about 5,000 civilian employees. Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. Shawn Bratton last month suggested the service could be on a path to double in size over the next decade, citing growing operational demands. Meink did not outline specific growth targets. But he said he has spent \u201cmany hours\u201d with Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman discussing how to expand the workforce as the joint force relies more heavily on satellite-based services and new missions emerge in areas such as missile defense and space-based targeting. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to increase the size of the Space Force because they need more of everything,\u201d Meink said. As the smallest military branch, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s no question the Space Force is going to grow quite a bit compared to the other services.\u201d Any expansion would require congressional support. Meink said there appears to be momentum in the fiscal 2026 budget debate to increase the scope of Space Force activities. Saltzman, speaking after Meink, underscored the scale imbalance between the services. The Air Force outnumbers the Space Force by more than 30 to one, he noted. \u201cYet we must provide combat capabilities and combat forces across all domains, for nearly every joint force mission around the world,\u201d he said. The Space Force\u2019s roughly 15,000 total personnel must integrate with a joint force of about 1.3 million service members. Because of its lean structure, Saltzman said, the service has limited surge capacity. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to waste energy or resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the capacity to surge hundreds of guardians to fill capability gaps until a solution arrives.\u201d The push for growth reflects not only mission expansion but a shift in how space systems are operated. Meink said the service will require operators skilled in managing increasingly automated constellations. \u201cThe old manual ways are not going to cut it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to automate virtually all aspects of operating and orchestrating satellite constellations.\u201d That emphasis is tied to a broader Department of the Air Force effort known as the DAF Battle Network, an initiative to build an integrated digital command-and-control architecture linking sensors, decision tools and weapons across the Air Force and Space Force. The objective is to ensure that data from satellites, aircraft, ground radars, cyber systems and other sources can be fused and delivered quickly to decision-makers. On the acquisition side, Meink said the department can no longer buy satellites, aircraft, software and communications systems as separate, standalone platforms. They must be procured as interoperable components of a digital enterprise. That shift requires different contracting approaches, faster software iteration and closer alignment between requirements, acquisition and operations. Underlying much of the service\u2019s planning is the ongoing \u201cObjective Force\u201d study, an internal effort led by SWAC to define what the Space Force should look like by 2040. Saltzman described the study as an examination of future operating environments, technology trends and adversary capabilities. \u201cFor the last year, a small team of expert analysts and strategists have been defining our future ope",

                                    "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As it plans for a future in which satellites can be refueled in orbit, the U.S. Space Force has taken a step that signals intent without yet committing to a full logistics network. Earlier this month, the service sought industry input through a request for information issued by the Servicing, Mobility and Logistics program office within Space Systems Command. The RFI asks for \u201ctechnical concepts and approaches to refueling services for prepared clients in orbit,\u201d with an expectation that solutions could be operational by 2030. \u201cThe RFI is a very positive step,\u201d said Clare Martin, senior vice president of Astroscale U.S.. Astroscale is building a refueling vehicle, partially funded by the Space Force, and preparing for its first mission in geostationary orbit. The spacecraft, called Provisioner, will attempt hydrazine refueling operations of a U.S. military satellite. In 2024, the service selected two refueling ports \u2014 RAFTI and PRM \u2014 as its preferred hardware interfaces for spacecraft that may one day receive fuel on orbit. The move provides satellite manufacturers and servicing companies with clearer guidance on how to design vehicles that can connect in space. But selecting ports is the beginning, not the end, of the effort. An interface standard does not ensure that tankers will exist in sufficient numbers, that propellant types will align across programs or that pricing will be competitive with simply replacing a satellite. Nor does it answer how refueling vehicles would operate in a contested environment. The Space Force still lacks visibility into whether a commercial refueling market will mature on its own or require sustained government underwriting. Astroscale\u2019s Provisioner is equipped with RAFTI, short for Rapidly Attachable Fluid Transfer Interface, developed by Orbit Fab. The second selected port, PRM, or Passive Refueling Module, was developed by Northrop Grumman. By selecting two interfaces, Martin said, the Space Force is acknowledging that multiple technical approaches may coexist. The goal is to reduce fragmentation without locking in a single vendor. Although Provisioner uses RAFTI, \u201cas a company, we are interface agnostic,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe try not to get locked into the widget and focus instead on providing the solution.\u201d Leading up to the selection, the Space Force \u201cput a lot of time and work into assessing them and their capability,\u201d she said, adding that RAFTI and PRM are the most mature options. \u201cThey\u2019ve specified those interfaces, but they\u2019ve left the rest up to industry to determine how you would interact with them.\u201d From an acquisition standpoint, the selection is meant to enable future service contracts. If multiple national security satellite programs converge on compatible ports, the government could buy refueling \u201cas a service\u201d rather than paying to integrate a bespoke solution for each mission. The RFI suggests the Space Force is looking beyond demonstration missions toward a broader architecture. \u201cIt is a good sign that the work they\u2019re doing now is going to move beyond this initial phase and into the future,\u201d Martin said. That next phase involves questions that extend well beyond a docking port. Companies like Astroscale, Northrop Grumman and others are developing shuttles that would travel between a client satellite and a propellant depot. For PRM-equipped spacecraft, Northrop has developed an Active Refueling Module to transfer fuel. Orbit Fab has developed a nozzle system known as GRIP to interface with RAFTI. The architecture itself remains unsettled. \u201cYou could have a client vehicle go straight to a depot. You could have a depot come to a client. Or you can have the service shuttle move between the two,\u201d Martin said. Building that ecosystem requires coordination across suppliers. \u201cIn order to give us the building blocks from which we can build our services, we\u2019ll need to look at how we actually source the fuel. Where do you get the hydrazine from? We\u2019ll need to work with the ",

AST, based in Midland, Texas, said it will use its BlueBird satellite constellation to \u201cdemonstrate resilient, low-latency tactical satellite communications.\u201d In a series of demonstrations to be completed by December 2027, the company will attempt \u201cseamless integration with existing tactical military radios and demonstrate how commercial satellite infrastructure can be rapidly applied for defense applications and deliver data products as-a-service to the Space Development Agency.\u201d The firm-fixed-price award was issued under SDA\u2019s Hybrid Acquisition for Proliferated Low Earth Orbit, or HALO, an Other Transaction agreement designed to fund rapid on-orbit experiments. SDA, a U.S. Space Force organization, is building the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a large constellation of low Earth orbit satellites intended to support missile warning, tracking, data transport and other military missions. The agency\u2019s strategy is to field satellites in iterative \u201ctranches,\u201d adding capability over time. HALO serves as a proving ground for technologies that might later be folded into those operational layers. In October 2024, SDA selected 19 companies for the HALO vendor pool. Each received a modest initial agreement and eligibility to compete for prototype task orders. The structure allows SDA to test new capabilities under compressed timelines before committing them to future tranches of the PWSA. The AST award falls under HALO\u2019s \u201cEuropa\u201d procurement, part of the Tranche 2 Demonstration and Experimentation System. Technologies that perform well in Europa demonstrations can inform or transition into the broader architecture. GP Sandhoo, SDA\u2019s acting director, said the agency is \u201cusing commercial solutions to quickly demonstrate mission utility, reduce risk for the operational layers of future tranches of the PWSA, and accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge capability to the warfighter.\u201d AST SpaceMobile is building a space-based cellular broadband network designed to connect directly with unmodified commercial smartphones. Its satellites carry large phased-array antennas intended to link standard mobile devices to orbiting spacecraft without specialized terminals. The company has pitched the system as a way to extend coverage to remote regions and disaster zones. For AST SpaceMobile, the new contract represents another step toward positioning a consumer-focused broadband system as relevant to defense missions. Last year the company announced an estimated $43 million contract supporting SDA through an undisclosed prime contractor. In 2024, it tested its BlueWalker-3 satellite under an earlier SDA agreement. The company is preparing to launch BlueBird-7 on the next flight of Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn heavy rocket. According to AST, the latest BlueBird satellites carry phased-array antennas spanning roughly 2,400 square feet, among the largest commercial arrays deployed in low Earth orbit.

                                    "description": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Aalyria announced a $100 million funding round Feb. 23 that values the Californian venture at $1.3 billion, supporting deployment of laser terminals and software for dynamically routing data across space, air and ground networks. The funding follows growing demand for narrow, high-throughput directional links that can improve speed and security but also add operational complexity as motion, weather and other line-of-sight constraints risk disrupting connectivity. Aalyria, spun out of Google\u2019s parent Alphabet four years ago, says its Spacetime platform can coordinate those links in real time, allocating capacity and routing traffic as satellites, aircraft and ground terminals move. Spacetime is also designed to help multi-orbit networks respond more quickly to disruptions, such as shifting capacity toward areas where terrestrial infrastructure has been damaged. While Alphabet previously used the software for its scrapped Loon internet network of high-altitude balloons, Telesat\u2019s low Earth orbit (LEO) Lightspeed constellation, which the Canadian geostationary operator aims to roll out next year, is set to be the first to use Spacetime commercially. \u201cAalyria\u2019s orchestration and network-optimization technologies are a key performance and resiliency enabler for our Telesat Lightspeed architecture,\u201d Telesat CEO Dan Goldberg said in Aalyria\u2019s funding news release. \u201cSpacetime\u2019s dynamic routing, spectrum-aware resource management, and advanced link prediction capabilities will be integrated with our system design, strengthening end-to-end service delivery across our global LEO network.\u201d The U.S. government has partnered to demonstrate Spacetime under the Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s hybrid space architecture initiative. Aalyria has also established a European arm following a 2023 European Space Agency contract. In its funding announcement, Aalyria highlighted other previously disclosed Spacetime partnerships with Google Public Sector, NASA, Airbus, ALL.SPACE, Keysight Technologies and Logos Space. Alongside Spacetime, the company said the funds will help expand deployment of its Tightbeam laser terminals, which also stem in part from Alphabet-era research. Chris Taylor, Aalyria\u2019s founder and CEO, said Tightbeam is currently proven across ground-to-ground, air-to-ground and ground-to-air links, amid ongoing tests with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory to validate the technology for military applications. \u201cOur plan is to take Tightbeam into space, developing optical ground terminals and space-to-ground terminals,\u201d he told SpaceNews via email, \u201cextending the platform into one of the most demanding and high-value connectivity environments in the world.\u201d Aalyria did not provide more details on Tightbeam or an update on its 2023 partnership with Intelsat, now owned by SES, to create a bi-directional optical ground and space network capable of speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second. Taylor also said Aalyria has now raised $135 million in total as it seeks to accelerate hiring across engineering and sales teams across both commercial and government markets.

                                    "description": "Following the successful launch of Ariane 6 in 2025, Europe\u2019s access to space ambitions gain momentum. The launch of the reusable launcher first stage demonstrator Themis T1H under the SALTO project represents a decisive step towards sustainable and autonomous access to space. Other EU-backed initiatives \u2013 including the ENLIGHTEN project and an upcoming \u20ac20 million call for game-changing technologies \u2013 aim to further accelerate Europe\u2019s progress in access to space. EU-backed space research activities advance Europe\u2019s access to space The recent flight of Europe\u2019s Ariane 6 flagship launcher, in its most powerful 4-booster configuration, marked the renewal of European autonomous access to space, and its capacity to deliver high-performance service for both institutional and commercial customers. Ariane 6 together with Vega C, with an important launch schedule manifest in 2026, provides Europe\u2019s launcher family with a complementary capability covering heavy and medium lift missions. Over the past decades, the European Commission significantly increased investment in space research and innovation. Under Horizon Europe, the EU Space Research and Innovation (R&I) Programme specifically tackles access to space to strengthen critical technologies developments and support ground facilities with the objectives to enhance competitiveness and reinforce the European access to space. The space research projects are directly managed by the Space Research Unit of the European Commission\u2019s Executive Agency HaDEA and have been delivering tangible results. Access to space is a strategic capability for the EU to enable it to deploy fully independently its missions and constellations such as Galileo, Copernicus and Iris2. The EU supports non-dependence and strategic autonomy in this field and \u20ac120 million have been invested for access to space research activities so far in the Horizon Europe framework programme. Europe\u2019s first reusable launcher flight campaign Having its own reusable launcher is a cornerstone of Europe\u2019s ambition to enhance its autonomous and sustainable access to space capability by increasing maximum achievable launch rate. Europe is committed to mastering launcher reusability, both through ESA\u2019s and European Commission\u2019s efforts. The SALTO project is a large endeavour and it brings together 26 important EU industry players working on reusable launchers technologies and operations. It builds on the first phase of the European Space Agency\u2019s (ESA) endeavour to develop a reusable rocket, using the launcher first stage prototype \u201cThemis T1H\u201d manufactured under the ESA\u2019s Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP) with ArianeGroup as prime contractor. The Themis T1H prototype included the development of a flight test demonstrator for low-cost rocket recovery and reuse technologies, at a scale representative of a medium-sized launcher. It notably embarks the high-power, variable-thrust, reusable engine Prometheus\u00ae, also developed by ArianeGroup. The SALTO project\u2019s main activity is the T1H flight test campaign, targeting three low-altitude flights (vertical take-off and landing), with the goal of demonstrating the vehicle\u2019s ability to lift off, land, be recovered, refurbished and prepared for the next flight. The Themis development and the SALTO flight test campaign also represent a shift in the European space R&D mindset, embracing greater risk-taking through a \u201ctest and learn\u201d approach. This involves building prototypes, conducting test flights with calculated risks, and learning from each step of the process. Real-life testing will show critical issues that are difficult to simulate. This approach aims at accelerating innovation, substantially reducing costs and achieving a constantly improving system. Themis T1H will be operated from the Swedish Space Corporation\u2019s ESRANGE Space Centre in northern Sweden, and the first low-altitude \u201chop\u201d \u2013 a vertical takeoff and landing manoeuvre \u2013 is planned for 2026.

                                    "title": "ENGINEERING BEHIND EARTHDAILY: SOLVING FOR GLOBAL DAILY COVERAGE, SCIENTIFIC QUALITY, AND HIGH-SPECTRAL DIVERSITY",
                                    "description": "Broad-area change detection only matters if the measurement behind it is stable. In Earth observation, frequency without calibration creates volatility, and imagery without consistency erodes trust over time. EarthDaily was designed around a simple principle: global daily coverage must be paired with scientific rigor, spectral depth, and long-term measurement integrity. What follows is the engineering discipline required to make that standard a reality. From conception to first launch in 2025, EarthDaily made a deliberate choice to invest the time required to build a mission people can trust, not just one that they can see. Most commercial optical satellites are built around a single or limited number of primary imaging assemblies: a small number of optical paths delivering multispectral or hyperspectral data through a unified instrument. Our architecture required solving for sixteen imagers per spacecraft. This allows maintaining a consistent imaging geometry and consistent operating environment for the imagers which is important to maintain high data quality. Each satellite integrates sixteen independent imaging assemblies operating in coordination. Sixteen focal planes. Sixteen alignment geometries. Sixteen thermal profiles. Sixteen radiometric responses operating under constant motion and changing illumination. That architecture enables achieving the wide swath per satellite and limiting the number of satellites to 10 for the constellation to achieve global daily coverage where each must have very high pointing control and stability performance and precise orbit control performance. It also multiplies calibration complexity, particularly in thermal bands where performance must be continuously characterized to maintain measurement integrity. Sixteen optical instruments do not behave identically. Thermal shifts, detector variability, and atmospheric effects introduce small differences that must be observed, modeled, and constrained until the system performs as a single coherent measurement system. Across the planned ten-spacecraft constellation, that complexity scales to 160 coordinated imaging assemblies \u2014 effectively 160 single-instruments aligned into one integrated measurement system. On the ground, those streams are aligned, calibrated, and harmonized into a single unified dataset. Rigorous laboratory testing can only reveal so much. The true test comes on orbit, when hardware is pushed to its limits and external variables come into play. To understand what has been built, it is necessary to understand the gap it was designed to solve. Agriculture companies needed something that doesn\u2019t exist: daily, scientifically reliable imagery with stable radiometry and geometry. They needed data they could trust at scale to support farmers and agronomic decisions. That same gap is being felt across other industries: the geospatial market lacked a system capable of delivering daily, broad-area coverage with science-grade radiometric and geometric stability and relatively high resolution (e.g., 5 m). No commercial provider can deliver that combination of frequency, coverage, resolution, and scientific measurement rigor. That requirement is the foundation of the EarthDaily Constellation \u2014 trust over time. Our first concept focused on five core VNIR spectral bands at 5 m GSD with daily global land mass coverage aimed at agricultural monitoring. Our objective was repeatable, calibrated measurement across vast land areas and across seasons. From that starting point, the spacecraft evolved into the 16 imager and 22-band design, covering a very broad spectral range that includes VNIR, SWIR and Thermal. The band selection was driven by measurement quality, atmospheric characterization, water vapor correction, improved cloud masking, and reliable separation of cloud from snow and the ability to accurately cross-calibrate to other ultra-high quality science satellites. This spectral band combination provides for much improved image product q",

                                    "description": "Humanity gains insight on how to operate in space with every satellite that we launch. True learning comes from doing; otherwise we lock into lab-born biases that come from asking the wrong questions. I think we are running into that limit with micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) collisions, and we are close to an industry-wide shift in how MMOD risk is considered and mitigated on future missions. If the natural space environment were uniformly, prohibitively dangerous, we would have discovered that long ago. Sputnik would have been blasted out of the sky by meteoroids, comet tails and asteroid fragments. We discovered instead that space was somewhat stable, and developed engineering norms to mitigate against its most extreme characteristics of temperature, vacuum, and charge. What changed since the 1960s is traffic and a slow \u201cpolluting\u201d with many millions of pieces of orbital debris. That is the modern MMOD environment. Most smallsats do not carry dedicated debris protection systems. Orbital Debris Assessment Report (ODAR) analysis and the observed success of commercial operators, plus the instinct to copy what worked last time, have produced modest success. Satellites are small relative to orbital volume, and propulsion allows avoidance when a conjunction is identified. The \u201cbig hits\u201d and spacecraft-on-spacecraft collisions feel tractable because we can track them. We can see them. Seeing is not just believing, but knowing, and we have decent instincts for how often to worry and which mitigations work. Micro-MMOD is a different matter. It may be where the great mysteries lie. Micro-MMOD means the untracked population under 3 millimeters in size. It is the vast majority of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) by count. If we cannot track them, how do we know they are there? NASA\u2019s Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) which flew between 1984\u20131990, was built to answer questions like that: fly standard materials and subsystems in LEO for years, then bring them home and let people put hands and microscopes on the scars. What we found was a messy, directional, high-flux environment. As NASA summarized: \u201cOver 30,000 observable MMOD strikes were identified on the exterior of LDEF\u2026 approximately 20x more impacts on the forward face relative to the aft face, and 200x more on the forward than Earth-facing sides.\u201d I fell out of my chair when I read that. Thirty thousand holes. Over 5.75 years, that is roughly 5,217 strikes per year at about 450 km altitude. LDEF\u2019s exterior area was roughly 151.975 square meters, which works out to about 34 hits per square meter per year at historical debris levels. That was around 1990, when the population was roughly a third of today. Extrapolate crudely and you are in the neighborhood of 100 hits per square meter per year in busy LEO. Could it be that modern ESPA-class satellites are getting pinged once or twice a day? When I share this, friends who run constellations cannot believe the number. In the same breath, they\u2019ll say MMOD is not a significant driver and that they have no requirement to go beyond ODAR. How do we square that circle? Part of the answer is that not all hits are equal. The viral hypervelocity videos that turn aluminum into confetti are accurate, but they are not the average case. LDEF\u2019s majority holes were tiny, sub-millimeter punctures. MMOD strikes do not all look the same. Some are catastrophic, like the cinematic chain-reactions in \u201cGravity\u201d (2014). Many are micro-perforations through structures, cloth or tanks. Those can still create secondary debris without killing a satellite. And because we seldom see what is happening in situ, failures get misattributed. How many satellites have quietly failed because of MMOD? How many MMOD signatures look a lot like proton hits? We should expect some of that confusion. This is why I keep saying that video and sample return are prerequisites for honest MMOD risk assessment. Think like an epidemiologist. You are looking at particle pop",

                                    "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Texas Space Commission has completed awarding $150 million to companies and organizations in the state as it prepares to distribute a second, larger round of funding. At a Feb. 17 board meeting, commissioners approved $14.15 million for a proposal by Rice University to establish a Center for Space Technologies at the Rice Space Institute. The center would work on technologies for sustainable human lunar exploration and in situ resource utilization. The grant committed the remaining balance in the commission\u2019s Space Exploration and Aeronautics Research Fund, or SEARF. The Texas Legislature appropriated $150 million for the fund in its 2023 session. The amount awarded to Rice was slightly less than the $16 million the university requested. The board said it would work with Rice to refine the scope of the proposal to align with the available funding. Through SEARF, the commission funded 24 projects intended to support the state\u2019s space industry. The awards went to a mix of established space companies, including Blue Origin and SpaceX, as well as startups, organizations and local governments. The funds support projects ranging from factories and other infrastructure to educational initiatives and spaceport studies. \u201cIt was honestly looking across the ecosystem and trying to figure out what\u2019s the best way for us, in the first years as a commission, to lay seeds for future growth,\u201d said Kathy Lueders, vice chair of the commission, during a panel at SpaceCom Expo in late January. The funding largely focused on later-stage projects, she said, for \u201ccompanies that need that last bit of investment or a little bit extra push to be able to be more successful.\u201d The 24 selected projects came from a much larger pool of applicants. \u201cThere was a helluva demand signal,\u201d Lueders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us realized we were going to get 280 grant proposals.\u201d Norman Garza Jr., executive director of the Texas Space Commission, said during the panel that the 280 proposals came from 140 unique entities and represented a combined $3.4 billion in requested funding. While commission staff reviewed applications for compliance with program rules, the board evaluated the technical content and selected the projects for funding rather than relying solely on staff recommendations. \u201cThey are the true subject matter experts. They are the evaluators,\u201d he said of the board. Although the initial $150 million allocated to SEARF has been committed, the commission has received a new $300 million appropriation from the Legislature. Lueders said the next round of awards will build on the previous funding cycle. \u201cHow do we help from an infrastructure standpoint? How do we help some of these key areas such as LEO, lunar economy growth?\u201d she said. \u201cIdeally that will be rolling out in our next request for grant proposals that we\u2019re shooting for in the next four to six months.\u201d \u201cNow that we have a new $300 million, we\u2019re hopeful to be able to get through that in-the-weeds bureaucratic process as quickly as possible to put something out on the street,\u201d Garza said.

                                    "description": "Satellite-based radar images show where a powerful earthquake in the Yukon, Canada, sent rock, snow, and ice spilling across the frozen landscapes of the St. Elias Mountains. On December 6, 2025, a powerful magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck the remote St. Elias Mountains, a highly glaciated range that spans the Yukon-Alaska border. The quake shook the landscape beneath Hubbard Glacier, sending ice and rock careening down the range\u2019s steep slopes. The NISAR (NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) satellite offered some of the earliest views of the changed landscape. Geophysicist Eric Fielding and colleagues at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) typically use satellite data to map the displacement of the ground after major earthquakes strike land. But in this region, such maps\u2014known as interferograms\u2014are not possible because the ground lies buried beneath a layer of glacial ice that\u2019s at least 700 meters (2,000 feet) thick. \u201cThe cryosphere is covering up the geosphere,\u201d Fielding said. Instead, clues to the earthquake\u2019s destructive power lay strewn atop the ice surface. The shaking on December 6 unleashed landslides and avalanches that swept debris onto lower, flatter stretches of the glacier. The debris is visible in radar imagery acquired by NISAR on December 8, two days after the quake (right). For comparison, the NISAR image on the left shows the same area on November 26, a week and a half before the quake. Where the slides have deposited rock, snow, and other debris, surfaces have become rougher, which scatters more energy back toward the sensor and makes those areas appear bright in the December 8 image (the roughest areas are shown in dark green). Areas with smooth surfaces reflect little of the radar\u2019s energy directly back to the satellite sensor, so these parts of the images appear dark (shown in purple). Note that there are some exceptionally rough, green surfaces beyond the new slide areas that remain relatively unchanged between the two images. The largest slide in the scene appears to be cascading down the flank of Mount King George, but it\u2019s far from the only one. Numerous others scar the surrounding terrain, including areas to the west along the slopes of Mount Logan, Canada\u2019s tallest mountain. Alex Gardner, a glaciologist at JPL and member of the NISAR science team, reviewed the images with Fielding. \u201cThe sheer number and magnitude of avalanches and landslides is astounding,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cI\u2019ve personally never seen anything like this before.\u201d A separate preliminary analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey identified more than 700 potential landslides and snow avalanches, with an especially high concentration northwest of the epicenter along the fault rupture. Follow-up flights by the Yukon Geological Survey on December 12 provided a closer look, showing some slopes remained actively unstable, with dust still hanging in the air, and widespread damage to glacial ice. Much of the debris that settled atop the region\u2019s glacial ice is likely being transported toward the ocean by the glaciers' ongoing seaward flow, which acts as a natural \"conveyor belt.\" For example, a tributary glacier of Hubbard north of Mount King George, which had previously moved at a sluggish pace, entered a surging phase in November before the earthquake. It is now moving downslope at what Gardner described as \u201cbreakneck speeds\u201d of up to 6,000 meters per year (about 50 feet per day). Although the region is uninhabited, the slides and damaged ice could pose new hazards for mountaineers and other expeditions, USGS noted in a December 18 update. The town of Yakutat, Alaska, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of the epicenter, is a common staging point for people exploring the area. NISAR observations are expected to provide imagery to support future natural disaster response efforts.

As was mentioned last week, we're now in the final phase of the boxwork exploration campaign. We're currently making our way toward the eastern contact of the boxwork formation with the surrounding geology, which we plan to drive along before turning our attention to the southern contact. That will likely be our last opportunity to directly interrogate the boxwork area before we continue our adventure up the slopes of Mount Sharp. Along the way, we've been performing our usual investigations of the geology that we encounter at our parking locations. As always, this includes contact science on bedrock targets close to the rover, ChemCam LIBS observations of targets slightly further afield, and a number of ChemCam RMI and Mastcam mosaics. These mosaics include observations deeper into the \u201cTapiche\u201d hollow where we're parked and the \u201cLos Flamencos\u201d ridge to its south, which we plan on investigating closer in the coming week.

Now, the Eclipse Megamovie team has released the remarkable new dataset that resulted from this effort \u2014 the first-ever, white-light eclipse dataset with calibration frames, spanning more than a cumulative hour and a half of observations of the solar corona. This data, which includes 52,469 total photographs uploaded by project volunteers, is now live: https://eclipsemegamovie.org/database. The data include contributions from 143 unique, mobile, volunteer-led \u201cobservatories\u201d \u2013 people with cameras charged with taking precise images of the eclipse, taking extra steps to allow the painstaking calibration required to reveal how the corona evolves from one person's view to the next. Researchers around the world can now use these observations to identify solar jets leaving the Sun's surface and study how solar plumes grow and develop. The public can also peruse and download all of this data, which is highly accessible and searchable by observatory name and location. \"Thank you for all you do and have done for us,\u201d said Eclipse Megamovie volunteer Jessi McKenna. \u201cEveryone in the group has been amazingly supportive of each other. And those who are running things are always so obviously appreciative of everyone who has contributed to the project.\" The files include data at three different levels of processing, from raw (level 1) data to calibrated (level 3) data, in a format called FITS, or Flexible Image Transport System. It is the standard astronomical data format used by NASA and the International Astronomical Union. Of the 143 unique observatories involved, 28 observatories had clear skies, sufficient calibration frames, and enough unique exposure times to create calibrated level 3 images. The Eclipse Megamovie team at Sonoma State University and the University of California, Berkeley and collaborators at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center began working together long before the eclipse to construct this database, together with EdEon STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics) Learning programmer Troy Wilson. But crucially, Eclipse Megamovie 2024 was made possible because of hundreds of volunteers who journeyed into the path of the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse with their cameras, patience, and curiosity. Measuring the motion of these plumes could help scientists understand the nature of the corona: what makes it so hot, and how it creates space weather. But these plumes can only be directly observed during an eclipse. Use data from NASA\u2019s Magnetosphere Multiscale Mission to shed light on solar storms.

                                    "description": "In the 1980s, sensors used to produce high-quality images for space science (including the amazing images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope) and other applications employed charge coupled device (CCD) technology. Dr. Eric Fossum was originally hired at JPL in 1990 to advance CCD technology for use in interplanetary space missions, but he ended up advancing another technology called complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology for that purpose and much more. While at JPL, Fossum took advantage of a technique commonly used for CCDs and applied it to CMOS sensors to develop the first CMOS active pixel image sensor. This development began a chain of events that led to the present use of CMOS technology not only in space science missions, but also in billions of cameras in smartphones, webcams, automobiles, and medical devices used worldwide. In 1990, CCDs were the primary technology used to generate high-quality images. CCD sensors consist of arrays of pixels that convert light into electric charges. The charge from each pixel is transferred step-by-step to an output amplifier at the corner of the sensor and converted to a voltage that represents the brightness of the light received at the corresponding pixel. The data from all the pixels is then aggregated to generate an image. While CCD cameras can produce very high-quality images that are suitable for scientific use, they require a lot of power and an efficient charge transfer process to be effective. CMOS sensors, on the other hand, have signal amplifiers within each pixel and signals can be read directly from each pixel instead of being transferred long distances to an amplifier for conversion. CMOS sensors therefore require less voltage to operate than CCDs and issues with the charge transfer process such as radiation susceptibility are greatly reduced. Although CMOS sensors existed in the 1990s, they produced too much noise to produce high-quality images required for science applications. To reduce the signal noise typical of CMOS sensors at that time, Fossum applied a technique that was often used in CCD devices. This technique\u2014called \u201cintra-pixel charge transfer with correlated double sampling\u201d\u2014enables a double measurement of a pixel\u2019s voltage without and with the light-generated charge. Subtracting the values of these two samples enables noise to be suppressed, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Soon several companies signed Technology Cooperation Agreements with JPL and partnered with Fossum and his colleagues to develop the promising new technology. In 1995, Fossum and co-worker Dr. Sabrina Kemeny licensed the technology from CalTech and founded a company called Photobit to develop CMOS sensors. In 1996, Fossum left JPL to work at Photobit full time. The Photobit, team further refined the CMOS technology to get it closer to CCD capabilities, reduce power requirements, and make manufacturing cheaper. Shortly thereafter, CMOS cameras started to be used in webcams, \u201cpill cams\u201d (small, swallowable devices that incorporate a tiny camera to take thousands of high-resolution images of the digestive tract), and other applications. In 2001 Photobit was acquired by Micron Technology, a larger company that devoted even more resources to development of CMOS technology. With the subsequent explosion of the cell phone industry, by 2013 more than a billion CMOS sensors were manufactured each year, and today that number has grown to about seven billion per year. The CMOS technology Dr. Fossum originally developed has not only enabled space science, it has been infused into devices we depend on every day, dramatically and positively transforming many aspects of our lives. Virtually all digital still and video cameras, including those on cell phones, employ them. In addition, CMOS technology is used in automotive electronics, webcams, sports cameras, industrial equipment, security cameras including doorbells, and cinematography cameras, and for medical and dental imaging",

                                    "description": "Winds blowing past the volcanic landmass near the Korean Peninsula created a trail of spiraling clouds, while murky water churned nearby. The tallest point in South Korea is not located in the Taebaek Mountains that run along the country\u2019s eastern coast. Rather, it is found atop a volcanic peak on Jeju Island, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the Korean Peninsula. In winter 2026, winds blew past the island in just the right way to send clouds spinning in its wake. The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA\u2019s Terra satellite captured this image of swirling clouds\u2014and colorful, turbulent water\u2014near Jeju Island on February 19, 2026. The island rises about 1,950 meters (6,400 feet) above the sea surface. At its center is Hallasan, a shield volcano that last erupted in the 11th century and contains a notable network of lava tubes. The trailing, staggered spirals, called von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex streets, form when a fluid passes a tall, isolated, stationary object. If winds are too weak, clouds simply flow smoothly past, and if winds are too strong, vortices cannot maintain their shape. In the sweet spot, with winds between 18 and 54 kilometers (11 and 34 miles) per hour, clouds trace the airflow in patterns of counterrotating vortices. Though the underlying physics is the same, the appearance of the vortices can vary: sometimes they look wispy, as they do here, and other times they form more sharply defined, parallel rows, as they did at the same location the previous day. The seas, as well as the atmosphere, were turbulent near Jeju Island in mid-February. To the west, a large plume of sediment coming off the coast of China\u2019s Jiangsu province turned waters murky. While brown, sediment-laden water is present in the shallow nearshore area year-round, expansive plumes like this one are common during winter. Research suggests that seasonal changes in currents and vertical mixing of the water column may account for the large winter plumes.

                                    "description": "For the first time, a much younger version of the Sun has been caught red-handed blowing bubbles in the galaxy, by astronomers using NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory. The bubble \u2013 called an \u201castrosphere\u201d \u2013 completely surrounds the juvenile star. Winds from the star\u2019s surface are blowing up the bubble and filling it with hot gas as it expands into much cooler galactic gas and dust surrounding the star. The Sun has a similar bubble around it, which scientists call the heliosphere, created by the solar wind. It extends far beyond the planets in our solar system and protects Earth from cosmic radiation. This is the first image of an astrosphere astronomers have obtained around a star similar to the Sun. It shows slightly extended emission, rather than a single point of light as seen for other such stars. \u201cWe have been studying our Sun\u2019s astrosphere for decades, but we can\u2019t see it from the outside,\u201d said Carey Lisse of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who led the study, which published [day of week] in the Astrophysical Journal. \u201cThis new Chandra result about a similar star\u2019s astrosphere teaches us about the shape of the Sun\u2019s, and how it has changed over billions of years as the Sun evolves and moves through the galaxy.\u201d The star is called HD 61005 and is located about 120 light-years from Earth, making it relatively close. HD 61005 has roughly the same mass and temperature as the Sun, but it is much younger with an age of about 100 million years, compared to the Sun\u2019s age of about 5 billion years. Because it is so young, HD 61005 has a much stronger wind of particles blowing from its surface that travels about 3 times faster and is about 25 times denser than the wind from the Sun. This amplifies the process of astrosphere bubble-blowing and mimics how our Sun was behaving several billion years ago. \u201cWe are impacted by the Sun every day, not only through the light it gives off, but also by the wind it sends out into space that can affect our satellites and potentially astronauts traveling to the Moon or Mars,\u201d said co-author Scott Wolk of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA). \u201cThis image of the astrosphere around HD 61005 gives us important information about what the Sun\u2019s wind may have been like early in its evolution.\u201d Astronomers have nicknamed the HD 61005 star system the \u201cMoth\u201d because it is surrounded by large amounts of dust patterned similarly to the shape of a moth\u2019s wings when viewed through infrared telescopes. The wings are formed from material left behind after the formation of the star, similar to the Kuiper Belt in our own solar system. Observations of these wings with NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope showed that the interstellar matter surrounding HD 61005 is about a thousand times denser than that around the Sun. Since the 1990s, astronomers have been trying to capture an image of an astrosphere around a Sun-like star. Chandra was able to detect the astrosphere around HD 61005 because it is producing X-rays as the stellar wind runs into cooler local interstellar medium dust and gas that surrounds the star. The dense local galactic environment, combined with Chandra\u2019s high-resolution X-ray vision, the strong stellar wind, and the star\u2019s proximity, all helped create a strong X-ray signal, allowing discovery of an astrosphere around HD 61005. It has a diameter about 200 times the distance from Earth to the Sun. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying about a moth being drawn to a flame,\u201d said co-author Brad Snios, formerly of CfA and now at MITRE, a non-profit that participates in federally funded research. \u201cIn the case of HD 61005, the \u2018Moth\u2019 can\u2019t easily escape from the flame because it was born around it and might be sustained by a disk around it.\u201d The Sun not only likely passed through a phase of development similar to HD 61005 when it was younger, it also likely traveled through a denser region of dust and gas than where the Sun is currently located, strengthening the connection with HD 61005. \u201cIt is amazing ",

                                    "description": "The Astronomy Activation Ambassadors (AAA) project, part of the NASA Science Activation program, aims to measurably enhance student STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics) engagement via middle school, high school, and community college science teacher professional development. AAA participants draw on NASA resources and subject matter experts to enhance their teaching and help share their excitement about astronomy and planetary science with their students. An important component of AAA teacher professional development is STEM immersion experiences, including guided tours of working observatories. Teacher visits to observatories offer a rare chance to connect science with history, culture, and place. Framing those visits around the historical context of astronomy and the cultural significance of \u201chigh places\u201d helps students see science as a human endeavor shaped by many voices. People everywhere look to the sky for meaning and knowledge, and mountain peaks often carry spiritual, cultural, and historical weight for local communities. The significance of these locations can be shared with their students. AAA STEM immersion experiences took place in Hilo, Hawaii, and Tucson, Arizona, respectively, in April and September 2025. During the weekend of April 12-13, 16 teachers from across the state of Hawai`i gathered in Hilo for a full agenda involving a hands-on electromagnetic spectrum and multiwavelength astronomy curriculum workshop, subject matter expert presentations regarding astronomy research and native Hawaiian perspectives on Maunakea, and a visit to the summit of Maunakea (Figures 1 & 2). Teacher participants expressed their appreciation especially for the summit visit portion of the workshop and had numerous discussions during the journey about ways they could incorporate this content into their teaching. The tour paused on the way up the mountain at the mid-level Onizuka Visitors Center. There, workshop participant, local high school teacher, and native Hawaiian cultural practitioner Toni Kaui addressed the group: \u201cStanding here, we have passed through the wao kele (vah-oh kay-lay; forested uplands) and are about to enter the wao akua (vah-oh ah-koo-ah), the heavenly realm where our spirits and our elements of sacredness lie. [\u2026] This is where we come to have our spiritual connection with the mauna (mountain). In the wao akua, all of our sacred and elemental processes happen, and those processes help to determine the well-being of our \u2018aina (-eye-nah; homeland) down below in the wao kanaka (vah-oh kah-nah-kah; human realm) where we came from.\u201d The Maunakea visit was recorded by the NASA Science Activation program\u2019s Infiniscope (Arizona State University) team, who joined AAA in the production of a virtual (video) tour highlighting both native Hawaiian and scientific researcher respect for the mountain. The virtual tour will be placed in the Infiniscope library (https://infiniscope.org) to be shared with a world-wide public audience. The AAA program\u2019s final workshop and STEM immersion experience was offered September 13-14 to 25 teachers from throughout the U.S. at the National Science Foundation\u2019s NOIRLab headquarters in Tucson, Arizona and at Kitt Peak National Observatory (Figure 3). Kitt Peak National Observatory is located within the land of the Tohono O\u2019odham (tuh-hoh-noh aw-tuhm) Native American tribe, whose name for Kitt Peak is I\u2019oligam Du\u2019ag (ee-oh-lih-gahm doo-ahg), meaning \u201cManzanita Shrub Mountain\u201d. Dr. Jacelle Ramon-Sauberan, Tohono O\u02bcodham Education Development Liaison with the NOIRLab, spoke with workshop participants regarding the long history of productive collaboration between local indigenous authorities and organizations developing and managing astronomy facilities on the mountain (Figure 4). She noted that the lease agreement between the Tohono O\u2019odham nation and the NSF: \u201c\u2026 is in perpetuity, as long as the mountain is used for astronomical study and research/education.\u201d The AAA parti",

A Dragon spacecraft will autonomously undock from the Harmony module\u2019s forward-facing port at 12:05 p.m. and fire its thrusters to move safely away from the space station. Splashdown is scheduled later that evening at approximately 11:44 p.m. PST off the California coast. NASA will not stream the splashdown but will post updates on its space station blog. Several scientific investigations are returning aboard Dragon, offering insights that could help shape future space exploration and life on Earth. The Euro Material Ageing study exposed 141 samples to space for a year to examine how coatings, insulation, and 3D-printed materials degrade, while Thailand\u2019s Liquid Crystals experiment observed the stability of films used in electronics in microgravity. Both could lead to stronger spacecraft, better displays, and improved optical devices on future missions. Frozen samples from the Stellar Stem Cells Mission 2 experiment are helping study how microgravity affects brain and heart stem cell growth, which could improve treatments for diseases such as ALS and Parkinson\u2019s disease. The SpaceDuino project is paving the way for more low-cost instruments after successfully measuring vibrations using a commercially available single-board computer and open-source software. The Moon Microscope also successfully tested a portable diagnostic kit for blood analysis in space that could support future missions to the Moon and Mars. The Dragon spacecraft supporting the mission also introduced a new capability to reboost the space station, helping maintain its altitude and counter atmospheric drag, which is critical for safe operations and the long-term sustainability of the orbital complex. During its time docked to the station, Dragon performed six reboosts \u2014 five in 2025 and a final maneuver on Jan. 23 \u2014 before preparations for its departure began. Loaded with thousands of pounds of crew supplies, science experiments, and equipment, the spacecraft arrived at the station on Aug. 25, 2025, following its launch a day earlier on a Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. For more than 25 years, people have lived and worked continuously aboard the International Space Station, advancing scientific knowledge and making research breakthroughs that are not possible on Earth. The station is a critical testbed for NASA to understand and overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight and to expand commercial opportunities in low Earth orbit. As commercial companies concentrate on providing human space transportation services and destinations as part of a robust low Earth orbit economy, NASA is focusing its resources on deep space missions to the Moon as part of the Artemis campaign in preparation for future astronaut missions to Mars.

                                    "description": "For about six months, NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover has been exploring a region full of geologic formations called boxwork, low ridges standing roughly 3 to 6 feet (1 to 2 meters) tall with sandy hollows in between. Crisscrossing the surface for miles, the formations suggest ancient groundwater flowed on this part of the Red Planet later than scientists expected. This possibility raises new questions about how long microbial life could have survived on Mars billions of years ago, before rivers and lakes dried up and left a freezing desert world behind. The boxwork formations look like giant spiderwebs when viewed from space. To explain the shapes, scientists have proposed that groundwater once flowed through large fractures in the bedrock, leaving behind minerals. Those minerals then strengthened the areas that became ridges while other portions without mineral reinforcement were eventually hollowed out by wind. Until Curiosity arrived at this region, however, no one could be sure what these formations looked like up close, and there were even more questions about how they were made. Although Earth also has boxwork ridges, they\u2019re rarely taller than a few centimeters and are usually found in caves or in dry, sandy environments. The Curiosity team wanted to get a close look at the Martian formations and gather more data. This posed a real challenge for rover drivers: They needed to send instructions to Curiosity, an SUV-size vehicle that weighs nearly a ton (899 kilograms), so that it could roll across the tops of ridges not much wider than the rover itself. \u201cIt almost feels like a highway we can drive on. But then we have to go down into the hollows, where you need to be mindful of Curiosity\u2019s wheels slipping or having trouble turning in the sand,\u201d said operations systems engineer Ashley Stroupe of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which built Curiosity and leads the mission. \u201cThere\u2019s always a solution. It just takes trying different paths.\u201d For scientists, the challenge is piecing together how such a vast network of boxwork could exist on Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain the rover has been ascending. Each layer of the mountain formed in a different era of Mars\u2019 ancient, changing climate. The higher Curiosity goes, the more the landscape bears signs that water was drying out over time, with occasional wet periods that saw the return of rivers and lakes. \u201cSeeing boxwork this far up the mountain suggests the groundwater table had to be pretty high,\u201d said Tina Seeger of Rice University in Houston, one of the mission scientists leading the boxwork investigation. \u201cAnd that means the water needed for sustaining life could have lasted much longer than we thought looking from orbit.\u201d Previous orbital imagery included one crucial piece of evidence: dark lines running across the \u201cspiderwebs.\u201d In 2014, it was proposed that these lines might be what are known as central fractures, where groundwater seeped through rock cracks and allowed minerals to concentrate. Investigating the ridges up close, Curiosity found that these lines are in fact fractures, lending weight to that hypothesis. The rover also discovered bumpy textures called nodules, an obvious sign of past groundwater that has been spotted many times by Curiosity and other Mars missions. Unexpectedly, these nodules were not found near the central fractures, but along a ridge\u2019s walls and the hollows between them. \u201cWe can\u2019t quite explain yet why the nodules appear where they do,\u201d Seeger said. \u201cMaybe the ridges were cemented by minerals first, and later episodes of groundwater left nodules around them.\u201d A major part of Curiosity\u2019s science centers on rock samples collected by the rock-pulverizing drill on the end of the rover\u2019s robotic arm. The resulting powder can be trickled into complex science instruments in the vehicle\u2019s body for analysis.

Perseverance is searching for signs of ancient microbial life, to advance NASA\u2019s quest to explore the past habitability of Mars. NASA chose Jezero Crater as the landing because scientists believe the area was once flooded with water and was home to an ancient river delta. In summer 2024, the rover collected a sample from the \u201cChevaya Falls\u201d rock which was found to have potential biosignatures \u2014 clues that suggest past life may have been present, but that require more data or further study before any conclusions about the absence or presence of life. In addition to making discoveries on Mars, the rover itself is demonstrating technological advances: A new technology developed at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California enables Perseverance to figure out its whereabouts without calling humans for help. Dubbed Mars Global Localization, the technology features an algorithm that rapidly compares panoramic images from the rover\u2019s navigation cameras with onboard orbital terrain maps.",

                                    "description": "A coordinated campaign targeting software developers with job-themed lures is using malicious repositories posing as legitimate Next.js projects and technical assessment materials, including recruiting coding tests. The attacker's goal is to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on developer machines, exfiltrate sensitive data, and introduce additional payloads on compromised systems. Next.js is a popular JavaScript framework used for building web applications. It runs on top of React and uses Node.js for the backend. The Microsoft Defender team says that the attacker created fake web app projects built with Next.js and disguised them as coding projects to share with developers during job interviews or technical assessments. The researchers initially identified a repository hosted on the Bitbucket cloud-based Git-based code hosting and collaboration service. However, they discovered multiple repositories that shared code structure, loader logic, and naming patterns. When the target clones the repository and opens it locally, following a standard workflow, they trigger malicious JavaScript that executes automatically when launching the app. The script downloads additional malicious code (a JavaScript backdoor) from the attacker's server and executes it directly in memory with the running Node.js process, allowing remote code execution on the machine. To increase the infection rate, the attackers embedded multiple execution triggers within the malicious repositories, Microsoft explained. These are summarized as follows: The infection process drops a JavaScript payload (Stage 1) that profiles the host and registers with a command-and-control (C2) endpoint, polling the server at fixed intervals. The infection then upgrades to a tasking controller (Stage 2) that connects to a separate C2 server, checks for tasks, executes supplied JavaScript in memory, and tracks spawned processes. The payload also supports file enumeration, directory browsing, and staged file exfiltration. Microsoft found that the campaign involved multiple repositories that shared naming conventions, loader structure, and staging infrastructure, indicating a coordinated effort rather than a one-off attack. Aside from the technical analysis, the researchers did not provide any details about the attacker or the extent of the operation. The tech giant advises that developers should treat standard workflows as the high-risk attack surfaces they really are and take appropriate precautions. The recommended mitigations include enforcing VS Code Workspace Trust/Restricted Mode, using Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules, and monitoring risky sign-ins with Entra ID Protection. Secrets stored on developer endpoints should be minimized, and short-lived tokens with the least required privileges should be used where possible.

                                    "description": "A financially motivated threat group dubbed \u201cDiesel Vortex\u201d is stealing credentials from freight and logistics operators in the U.S. and Europe in phishing attacks using 52 domains. In a campaign that has been running since September 2025, the threat actor has stolen 1,649 unique credentials from platforms and service providers critical in the freight industry. Some of the Diesel Vortex victims include DAT Truckstop, TIMOCOM, Teleroute, Penske Logistics, Girteka, and Electronic Funds Source (EFS). Researchers at the typosquatting monitoring platform Have I Been Squatted uncovered the campaign after finding an exposed repository containing an SQL database from a phishing project that the threat actor called Global Profit and marketed it to other cybercriminals under the name MC Profit Always. The repository also included a file with Telegram webhook logs that revealed communications between the phishing service operators. Based on the language used, the researchers believe that Diesel Vortex is an Armenian-speaking actor connected to Russian infrastructure. Have I Been Squatted's analysis efforts were joined by tokenization infrastructure provider Ctrl-Alt-Intel, which connected the dots between operators, infrastructure, and connections to various companies using open-source intelligence. In a lengthy technical report, the typosquatting protection provider states that it uncovered nearly 3,500 stolen credential pairs, with 1,649 of them being unique. The researchers say that they also found a link to a mind map created by a member of the group, which describes a \"highly organised operation\" complete with a call-centre, mail support, programmer rols, and staff responsible for finding drivers, carriers, and logistics contacts. Furthermore, the map provided details about acquisition channels that included the DAT One marketplace, email campaigns, rate confirmation fraud, and revenue for various operational tiers. \u201cThe [Diesel Vortex] group built dedicated phishing infrastructure for platforms used daily by freight brokers, trucking companies, and supply chain operators. Load boards, fleet management portals, fuel card systems, and freight exchanges were all in scope,\u201d Have I Been Squatted researchers say. \u201cThese platforms sit at the intersection of high transaction volumes and the targeted workforce isn\u2019t typically the primary focus of enterprise security programs, and the operators clearly knew it.\u201d The attacks involve sending phishing emails to targets via a phishing kit\u2019s mailer, using Zoho SMTP and Zeptomail, and combining Cyrilic homoglyph tricks in the sender and subject fields to evade security filters. Voice phishing and infiltration into Telegram channels frequented by trucking and logistics personnel were also used in the attacks. When a victim clicks a phishing link, they land on a minimal HTML page on a \u2018.com\u2019 domain with a full-screen iframe that loads the phishing content, followed by a 9-stage cloaking process on the system domain (.top/.icu). The phishing pages are pixel-level clones of the targeted logistics platforms. Depending on the target, they may capture credentials, permit data, MC/DOT numbers, RMIS login details, PINs, two-factor authentication codes, security tokens, payment amounts, payee names, and check numbers. The phishing process is under the operator's direct control, who decides when to approve steps and activate the next phases via Telegram bots.

                                    "description": "Wynn Resorts has confirmed that a hacker stole employee data from its systems after the company was listed on the ShinyHunters extortion gang's data leak site. In a statement shared today, the company said it activated its incident response procedures and launched an investigation, with assistance from external cybersecurity experts, after discovering the breach. \"We have learned that an unauthorized third party acquired certain employee data,\" reads a statement shared with BleepingComputer. \"Upon discovery, we immediately activated our incident response protocols and launched a thorough investigation with the help of external cybersecurity experts.\" While Wynn has not stated whether it paid a ransom to prevent the data leak, the company said the attackers confirmed the stolen data had been deleted. In past extortion cases, threat actors have typically only claimed data was deleted after reaching an agreement with a victim. \"The unauthorized third party has stated that the stolen data has been deleted. We are monitoring and to date have not seen any evidence that the data has been published or otherwise misused,\" the statement continued. The company added that the incident did not impact guest operations or its physical properties, which remain fully operational, and that it is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services to employees. This statement comes after Wynn Resorts appeared on the ShinyHunters data leak site on Thursday. In the threat actors' post, the group claimed it had stolen \"PII (SSNs, etc) and employee data\" and warned the company to make contact before February 23, 2026, or the data would be published. \"Over 800k records containing PII(SSNs, etc) and employee data have been compromised,\" reads the now-deleted post on ShinyHunters data leak site. \"This is a final warning to reach out by 23 Feb 2026 before we leak along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way. Make the right decision, don't be the next headling.\" Shortly after, the Wynn entry was removed from the site, a move that often occurs when negotiations are underway or claims are disputed. Wynn Resorts did not answer questions about whether a ransom was paid or how many people were affected. Similarly, ShinyHunters told BleepingComputer that they had no comment on whether they received a payment. However, the threat actors did previously claim to have stolen the data from the company's Oracle PeopleSoft environment. ShinyHunters is a data extortion group known for breaching organizations and threatening to publish stolen data unless a ransom is paid. The group has previously claimed responsibility for multiple high-profile data theft incidents and has operated across various underground forums and extortion portals over the years. Last year, ShinyHunters conducted a widespread campaign to steal Salesforce data, targeting numerous companies through social engineering and stolen third-party OAuth tokens. In recent weeks, ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a wave of other security breaches, including Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, Canada Goose, PornHub, and online dating giant Match Group. Some of the victims were compromised through voice phishing (vishing) attacks targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Google, Microsoft, and Okta, where the threat actors posed as IT support staff to trick employees into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites. As BleepingComputer first reported, the ShinyHunters group more recently adopted device code vishing to obtain Microsoft Entra authentication tokens. After stealing their targets' credentials and auth codes, the threat actors hijack the victims' SSO accounts to steal data from connected SaaS applications such as Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SAP, Slack, Adobe, Atlassian, Zendesk, Dropbox, and many others.

                                    "description": "A newly identified cybercrime service known as 1Campaign is enabling threat actors to run malicious Google Ads that remain online for extended periods while evading scrutiny from security researchers. 1Campaign is a cloaking service that passes Google\u2019s screening process and shows malicious content only to real potential victims. Security researchers and automated scanners are served benign white pages. The operation has been active for at least three years and is managed by a developer using the name \u2018DuppyMeister,\u2019 according to a report from data security company Varonis. \u201cThe tool passes Google's screening, filters out security researchers, and keeps phishing and crypto drainer pages online for as long as possible, funneling real users to attacker-controlled sites,\u201d the researchers say. 1Campaign provides \u201ccustomers\u201d with a user-friendly dashboard where they can get an overview of their operations and set the parameters for their campaigns. The platform can filter visitors in real time, directing traffic to landing pages based on predefined criteria, including geography, internet service provider (ISP), and device characteristics. The researchers say that this targeted approach allows attackers to concentrate on users in regions where the phishing lure is relevant, while filtering out traffic from countries with a higher likelihood of security scrutiny or scanning activity. In one instance, Varonis observed aggressive filtering that blocked 99.4% of 1,676 visitors accessing the malicious ads. This translates into a success rate of just 0.6%, or 10 visitors. The system evaluates each visitor and assigns a fraud risk score between 0 and 100. This reflects the likelihood of non-genuine visitors, and is derived from checking infrastructure details such as cloud providers, data centers, VPNs, and security vendors. \"Visitors from Microsoft Corporation, Google, Tencent Cloud Computing, OVH Hosting, and other cloud providers are automatically flagged with high fraud scores and blocked,\" Varonis says in a report today. Based on IP address ranges, ISP, and behavioral patterns, the system can also determine if the malicious ads are accessed by security scanners. Varonis has observed traffic linked to 1Campaign being distributed in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, China, Germany, France, Japan, Hungary, and Albania. The cybercrime platform also offers a Google Ads launcher tool that helps operators launch both malicious and benign campaigns. The developer claims that this tool enables bypassing Google\u2019s policy limitations and impersonating legitimate brands in ads. Despite Google introducing multiple safeguards, its ad platform is still used to promote fraud, malware, and crypto-drainers. 1Campaign stands out, though, as it is designed specifically to launch malicious ads that pass Google's automatic inspection and likely survive until victims report them or the campaign is reported manually. Such a cloaking system makes static URL scanning less effective. Varonis says that using realistic browser fingerprints and patterns that mimic human interaction would render better analysis and detection results. For automated detection, Varonis recommends rotating through a diverse IP pool and user-agent configurations to avoid consistent fingerprinting. Users are advised to avoid promoted search results, or at least treat them with suspicion, and bookmark official software distribution channels. Double-checking the URL in the address bar is also recommended before entering account credentials or other sensitive information.

CarGurus is a publicly traded automotive research and shopping company that operates in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Its website has an estimated 40 million monthly visitors and helps people find, compare, and contact sellers of new and used vehicles. On February 21, the threat group published a 6.1GB archive containing 12.4 million records, saying it was from CarGurus. A day later, the HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) data breach monitoring and alerting platform added the dataset, listing the following data types as compromised: Although CarGurus has not released an official statement disclosing a data breach and did not respond to BleepingComputer's request for comment, it is important to note that HIBP attempts to confirm the validity/authenticity of the leaked records before adding them. HIBP reports that 70% of the leaked data was already on its database from previous incidents, so roughly 3.7 million records are fresh. Since the information is freely available for download, cybercriminals could take advantage of it for phishing attacks. CarGurus users are advised to stay alert for potentially malicious communications and scam attempts leveraging the leaked information. The ShinyHunters data extortion group has been very active recently, claiming multiple attacks on large companies and leaking their data when negotiations reached a dead end. The most recent examples include Dutch telecommunications provider Odido, ad tech firm Optimizely, fintech firm Figure, outerwear brand Canada Goose, restaurant chain Panera Bread, online dating company Match Group, and music streaming platform SoundCloud. The threat group typically uses social engineering, most commonly voice phishing, to breach organizations, directing victims to credential-harvesting pages that grant them access to SaaS platforms such as Salesforce, Okta, and Microsoft 365. Previous ShinyHunters campaigns also involved tricking employees into installing malicious OAuth applications that granted them API-level read access to customer data tables inside Salesforce instances.

Currently, Microsoft Purview DLP policies apply only to files stored in SharePoint or OneDrive, but not to those stored on local devices. This change will be deployed through the Augmentation Loop (AugLoop) Office component between late March and late April 2026 to ensure that DLP controls apply to all Office documents, whether they are stored locally, in SharePoint, or OneDrive. \"This enhancement responds to customer feedback requesting more consistent protection coverage across local and cloud-based file locations,\" Microsoft said in a message center update. Once the change is deployed, Copilot will not be able to read or process Word, Excel, or PowerPoint documents that are labeled as restricted by DLP controls. Microsoft also stated that the changes will be automatically enabled for organizations with DLP policies configured to block Copilot from processing sensitivity-labeled content, without requiring any administrative action or changes. \"This update does not modify Copilot capabilities. Instead, Office clients and AugLoop have been enhanced so AugLoop can read a file's sensitivity label directly from the client,\" Microsoft added. \"Today, AugLoop retrieves the label by calling Microsoft Graph using the file's SharePoint or OneDrive URL, which limits DLP enforcement to files stored in OneDrive and SharePoint. By enabling the client to provide the label, DLP enforcement now applies uniformly across all storage locations, including local files.\" This comes on the heels of a software bug (described by Microsoft as a \"code issue\") that allowed Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat (the company's AI-powered, content-aware chat that lets users interact with AI agents) to read and summarize confidential emails in users' Sent Items and Drafts folders for nearly a month despite the emails being protected by active data loss prevention policies and labeled as confidential. The bug, which was first discovered on January 21, affected the Copilot \"work tab\" chat functionality, which mistakenly accessed and summarized emails stored in users' Sent Items and Drafts folders, including those labeled confidential and intended to be protected from automated tools by explicit confidentiality labels. In a statement to BleepingComputer, Microsoft explained that the bug provided access to the summarized information only to those who were already authorized to see it, but that the \"behavior did not meet our intended Copilot experience, which is designed to exclude protected content from Copilot access.\" Modern IT infrastructure moves faster than manual workflows can handle.

                                    "description": "Author: Itamar Apelblat, CEO and Co-Founder, Token Security Not long ago, AI deployments inside the enterprise meant copilots drafting emails or summarizing documents. Today, AI agents are provisioning infrastructure, answering customer support tickets, triaging alerts, approving transactions, writing production code, and so much more. They are no longer passive assistants. They are operators within the enterprise. For CISOs, this shift creates a familiar but amplified problem: access. Every AI agent authenticates to systems and services. It uses API keys, OAuth tokens, cloud roles, or service accounts. It reads data, writes configurations, and calls downstream tools. In other words, it behaves exactly like an identity, because it is one. Yet in many organizations, AI agents are not governed as first-class identities. They inherit the privileges of their creators. They operate under over-scoped service accounts. They are granted broad access just to make sure things work. Once deployed, they often evolve faster than the controls around them. This is the emerging blind spot in AI security. The first step toward closing it is what we call identity-first security for AI: recognizing that every autonomous agent must be governed, audited, and attested just like a human user or machine workload. That means unique identities, defined roles, clear ownership, lifecycle management, access control, and auditability. But here\u2019s the hard truth: identity alone is no longer sufficient. Traditional identity and access management (IAM) answers a straightforward question: Who is requesting access? In a human-driven world, that was often enough. Users had roles and job functions. Services had defined scopes. Workflows were relatively predictable. AI agents create, use, and rotate identities at machine speed\u2014outpacing traditional IAM controls. This guide shows CISOs how to manage the full lifecycle of AI agent identities, reduce risk, and maintain governance and audit readiness. They are dynamic by design. They interpret inputs, plan actions, and call tools based on context. An AI agent that begins with the mission to generate a quarterly report might, if prompted or misdirected, attempt to access systems unrelated to reporting. An infrastructure agent designed to remediate vulnerabilities might pivot to modifying configurations in ways that exceed its original scope. When that happens, identity-based controls don\u2019t necessarily stop it from happening. Traditional IAM assumes determinism. A role is granted because a user or service performs a defined function. The scope of action is predictable. AI agents break that assumption. Their objective may be fixed, but the path they take to achieve it is fluid. They reason, chain tools together, and explore alternative actions. Static roles were never designed for actors that decide how to act in real time. If the agent\u2019s role allows the action, access is granted, even if the action no longer aligns with the reason the agent was deployed in the first place. This is where intent-based permissioning becomes essential. If identity answers who, intent answers why. Intent-based permissions evaluate whether an agent\u2019s declared mission and runtime context justify activating its privileges at that moment. Access is no longer just a static mapping between identity and role. It becomes conditional on purpose. Consider an AI agent responsible for deploying code. In a traditional model, it may have standing permissions to modify infrastructure. In an intent-aware model, those privileges activate only when the deployment is tied to an approved pipeline event and change request. If the same agent attempts to modify production systems outside that context, the privileges do not activate that access. The identity hasn\u2019t changed, but the intent, and therefore the authorization, has. This combination addresses two of the most common failure modes we\u2019re seeing in AI deployments. First, privilege inheritance. Developers ofte",

                                    "description": "The UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has fined Reddit \u00a314.47 million (over $19.5 million) for collecting and using the personal information of children under 13 without adequate safeguards. As the ICO explained in a Tuesday press release, Reddit failed to implement a meaningful age-verification system on its platform until July 2025, even though its own terms of service prohibited users under 13. The data protection regulator also estimates that a significant number of underage children were using the social media platform before July 2025 and that Reddit processed their data without a lawful basis and potentially exposed them to harmful content. In July 2025, Reddit implemented age assurance measures, including an age verification system for accessing mature content and a self-declaration prompt for new accounts. However, the ICO criticized them for failing to meet UK data protection standards and noted that children can easily bypass them. \"It's concerning that a company the size of Reddit failed in its legal duty to protect the personal information of UK children. Children under 13 had their personal information collected and used in ways they could not understand, consent to or control. That left them potentially exposed to content they should not have seen. This is unacceptable and has resulted in today's fine,\" said UK Information Commissioner John Edwards. \"Relying on users to declare their age themselves is not enough when children may be at risk and we are focusing now on companies that are primarily using this method. I therefore strongly encourage industry to take note, reflect on their practices and urgently make any necessary improvements to their platforms.\" In a statement to BleepingComputer, a Reddit spokesperson said the company will appeal the ICO's decision and that \"according to external market research, the vast majority of Reddit users in the UK are adults.\" \"Reddit doesn't require users to share information about their identities, regardless of age, because we are deeply committed to their privacy and safety,\" the spokesperson added. \"The ICO's insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users' online privacy and safety. We intend to appeal the ICO's decision.\" Reddit says it has 121 million daily active users and over 471 million weekly active ones, spread across over 100,000 active communities. This fine follows a similar penalty issued on February 5 against MediaLab, the owner of the image-sharing platform Imgur, over children's privacy failures.

                                    "description": "SolarWinds has released security updates to patch four critical Serv-U remote code execution vulnerabilities that could grant attackers root access to unpatched servers. Serv-U is the company's self-hosted Windows and Linux file transfer software that comes with both Managed File Transfer (MFT) and FTP server capabilities, enabling organizations to securely exchange files via FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and HTTP/S. The most severe of the four security flaws patched by SolarWinds today in Serv-U 15.5.4 is tracked as CVE-2025-40538, and it allows attackers with high privileges to gain root or admin permissions on vulnerable servers. \"A broken access control vulnerability exists in Serv-U which, when exploited, gives an attacker the ability to create a system admin user and execute arbitrary code as root via domain admin or group admin privileges,\" SolarWinds said in a Tuesday advisory. The company also patched two type confusion flaws and an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that can be exploited to gain code execution with root privileges. Luckily, all four security flaws require attackers to already have high privileges on the targeted servers, which will limit potential exploitation attempts to scenarios where attackers can chain privilege escalation vulnerabilities or use previously stolen admin credentials. Shodan currently tracks over 12,000 Internet-exposed Serv-U servers, while Shadowserver estimates the number to be less than 1,200. \u200bFile transfer software like SolarWinds Serv-U is often targeted in attacks because it provides easy access to documents that may contain sensitive corporate and customer data. Over the last five years, multiple cybercrime and state-sponsored hacking groups have targeted Serv-U vulnerabilities in data theft attacks, with the Clop gang having exploited a Serv-U Secure FTP remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-35211) to breach corporate networks in ransomware attacks. China-based hackers (tracked by Microsoft as DEV-0322), known for primarily targeting U.S. defense and software companies, also deployed CVE-2021-35211 exploits in zero-day attacks starting in July 2021. More recently, in June 2024, cybersecurity companies Rapid7 and GreyNoise flagged a SolarWinds Serv-U path-traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-28995) as actively exploited by threat actors who used publicly available proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is currently tracking nine SolarWinds security flawsthat have either been or are still actively being exploited in the wild.

                                    "description": "The ShinyHunters extortion gang has claimed responsibility for breaching Dutch telecommunications provider Odido and stealing millions of user records from its compromised systems. Odido is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the Netherlands and offers mobile, broadband, and television services to millions of customers nationwide. The company disclosed the breach on February 12, revealing that attackers downloaded the personal data of many of its users after gaining access to its customer contact system on February 7. However, Odido added that no Mijn Odido passwords, call details, location, data, billing data, or scans of identity documents were exposed during the incident. According to the telecom firm, the exposed information varies per customer and may include a combination of full name, address and city of residence, mobile number, customer number, email address, IBAN (bank account number), date of birth, and some identification details (passport or driver's license number and validity). It also told local media at the time that the data breach affected 6.2 million customers and that the threat actors reached out to say they had stolen millions of user records. After discovering the incident, Odido has reported the breach to the Dutch Data Protection Authority, blocked the attackers' access to its systems, and hired external cybersecurity experts to assist with incident response and mitigation. An Odido spokesperson didn't provide further information on the incident when asked about which threat group was behind the attack and whether they demanded a ransom \"due to the ongoing investigations.\" While Odido has yet to attribute the attack, the ShinyHunters extortion gang has now added the company to its dark web leak site, claiming they've stolen nearly 21 million records containing data the company already revealed as exposed in the breach. ShinyHunters also told BleepingComputer on Monday that the stolen data also contains internal corporate data and plaintext passwords. However, an Odido spokesperson denied their claims in a statement to BleepingComputer, reiterating that \"no passwords, call details, social security numbers, or billing data are involved.\" \"This is a final warning to come back to our chat and finish what we set out to do before we leak along with several annoying (digital) problems that'll come your way,\" the extortion gang says on the leak site. \"Make the right decision, don't be the next headline. You know where to find us.\" In recent weeks, ShinyHunters has claimed responsibility for a wave of other security breaches, including Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, Canada Goose, PornHub, and online dating giant Match Group (which owns the Tinder, Hinge, Meetic, Match.com, and OkCupid dating platforms). Some of their victims had their systems compromised in voice phishing (vishing) attacks targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Google, Microsoft, and Okta, where the threat actors call employees while impersonating IT support staff and trick them into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites that mimic their companies' login portals. As BleepingComputer first reported, the ShinyHunters group has also recently adopted device code vishing, abusing the OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow to obtain Microsoft Entra authentication tokens. After stealing their targets' credentials and auth codes, the threat actors hijack the victims' SSO accounts to breach connected enterprise services like Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, SAP, Slack, Adobe, Atlassian, Zendesk, Dropbox, and many others.

                                    "description": "North Korean state-backed hackers associated with the Lazarus threat group are targeting U.S. healthcare organizations in extortion attacks using the Medusa ransomware. The Medusa ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation emerged in January 2021, and by February 2025, it impacted over 300 organizations in various critical infrastructure sectors. Since then, the gang claimed at least another 80 victims. North Korean threat actors have previously been linked to other ransomware strains such as HolyGhost, PLAY, Maui, Qilin, as well as other malware families. However, this is the first time security researchers have associated the actor with Medusa. In a report today, enterprise cybersecurity company Symantec says that a Lazarus subgroup, possibly Andariel/Stonefly, is now using Medusa in financially-motivated cyberattacks targeting U.S. healthcare providers. According to the researchers, the toolset used in these attacks also shows some association with Diamond Sleet, another North Korean group that typically targets media, defense, and IT industries. However, some of the utilities seen in the Medusa ransomware attacks are commodity tools: The researchers comment that no sectors are off-limits for North Korean hackers, who keep getting involved in cybercrime for financial gain. \u201cWhile some cybercrime outfits claim to steer clear of targeting healthcare organizations due to the reputational damage it may attract, Lazaurs doesn\u2019t seem to be in any way constrained,\u201d Symantec researchers say. Medusa targeted multiple healthcare and non-profit organizations in the U.S., as the gang's data leak site lists four such victims since the beginning of November 2025, among them an educational facility for autistic children. Not all these Medusa attacks can be confidently attributed to Lazarus hackers, though. Medusa can demand ransoms as large as $15 million, but Symantec researchers say that the average is around $260,000. Stolen funds are used to support espionage operations against entities in the defense, technology, and government sectors in the U.S., Taiwan, and South Korea. Symantec has provided a set of indicators of compromise (IoCs) in its report, which include network infrastructure data and hashes for the malware used in attacks.

                                    "description": "Several mental health mobile apps with millions of downloads on Google Play contain security vulnerabilities that could expose users\u2019 sensitive medical information. In one of the apps, security researchers discovered more than 85 medium- and high-severity vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise users\u2019 therapy data and privacy. Some of the products are AI companions designed to help people suffering from clinical depression, multiple forms of anxiety, panic attacks, stress, and bipolar disorder. At least six of the ten analyzed apps state that user conversations or chats remain private, or are encrypted securely on the vendor\u2019s servers. \u201cMental health data carries unique risks. On the dark web, therapy records sell for $1,000 or more per record, far more than credit card numbers,\u201d says Sergey Toshin, founder of mobile security company Oversecured. Oversecured scanned ten mobile apps advertised as tools that can help with various mental health problems, and uncovered a total of 1,575 security vulnerabilities (54 rated high-severity, 538 medium-severity, and 983 low-severity). Although none of the discovered issues are critical, many can be leveraged to intercept login credentials, spoof notifications, HTML injection, or to locate the user. The researchers used the Oversecured scanner to check the APK files of the ten mental health applications for known vulnerability patterns in dozens of categories. In a report shared with BleepingComputer, the researchers say that some of the verified apps \u201cparse user-supplied URIs without adequate validation.\u201d One therapy app with more than one million downloads uses Intent.parseUri() on an externally controlled string and launches the resulting messaging object (intent) without validating the target component. This allows an attacker to force the app to open any internal activity, even if it is not intended for external access. \u201cSince these internal activities often handle authentication tokens and session data, exploitation could give an attacker access to a user\u2019s therapy records,\u201d Oversecured explains. Another issue is storing data locally in a way that gives read access to any app on the device. Depending on the saved information, this could expose therapy details, such as therapy entries, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) session notes, and various scores. Oversecured states that they also discovered plaintext configuration data, including backend API endpoints and a hardcoded Firebase database URL, within the APK resources. Furthermore, some of the vulnerable apps use the cryptographically insecure java.util.Random class for generating session tokens or encryption keys. According to the researchers, \u201cmost of the 10 apps lack any form of root detection.\u201d On a rooted (jailbroken) device, any app with root privileges has access to all health data stored locally. Oversecured says that six of the ten analyzed apps \u201chad zero high-severity findings, but still carried medium-severity issues that weaken their overall security posture.\u201d \u201cThese apps collect and store some of the most sensitive personal data in mobile: therapy session transcripts, mood logs, medication schedules, self-harm indicators, and in some cases, information protected under HIPAA,\u201d the researchers note. From BleepingComputer\u2019s observations the collective download count for the apps scanned by Oversecured is more than 14.7 million, and only four received an update as recently as this month. For the rest, the date of the latest update was as recent as November 2025 or even September 2024. Oversecured\u2019s scans occurred between January 22 and 23 and targeted the latest app versions available at the time. The researchers cannot confirm if any of the uncovered vulnerabilities have been addressed. BleepingComputer has refrained from the sharing the names of the impacted apps as the vulnerabilities are still being disclosed by Oversecured.

                                    "description": "Spanish authorities have arrested four alleged members of a hacktivist group believed to have carried out cyberattacks targeting government ministries, political parties, and various public institutions. The group, which called itself \"Anonymous F\u00e9nix\" and claimed they were affiliated with the Anonymous hacker collective, conducted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets in Spain and several South American countries, according to the Spanish Civil Guard. The first attacks occurred in April 2023 and peaked after the flash floods that struck Valencia in late October 2024, when the group's members attacked multiple government websites, claiming Spanish authorities were responsible for the deaths and destruction caused by the storm. Anonymous F\u00e9nix also used X and Telegram to spread anti-government messaging and recruit volunteers for its campaigns. \"From September 2024 they increased their activity and initiated a campaign of recruitment of volunteers with the aim of perpetrating cyberattacks against relevant domains,\" the Spanish Civil Guard said over the weekend. \"They reached their peak after the DANA of Valencia when they managed to successfully attack different websites of the Public Administration, justifying that they were 'the responsible for the tragedy.'\" The Civil Guard arrested the group's administrator and moderator in May 2025, in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, near Madrid, and Oviedo, in the northern region of Asturias. After analyzing the evidence collected following those arrests, investigators identified two additional members of the group as its most active operatives, who were arrested earlier this month in Ibiza and M\u00f3stoles, near Madrid. Following the arrests, Spanish courts also ordered the seizure of the group's accounts on X and YouTube and ordered the closure of its Telegram channel. No details on specific charges or potential penalties were provided in the Civil Guard's announcement. In recent months, Spanish authorities also detained a 19-year-old suspect in Barcelona for allegedly breaching nine companies and dismantled the \"GXC Team\" crime-as-a-service (CaaS) platform that pushed AI-powered phishing kits, Android malware, and voice-scam tools. More recently, in January, the Spanish National Police arrested 34 suspects linked to a criminal network involved in cyber fraud and believed to be connected to the Black Axe crime ring.

                                    "description": "Microsoft is investigating a known issue that causes the mouse pointer to disappear in the classic Outlook desktop email client for some users. This bug has been acknowledged almost two months after the first reports started surfacing online, with users saying that Outlook became unusable after the mouse pointer vanished while using the app. \"My mouse just stopped being visible while I am using Outlook, and this is very, very, frustrating because my permission wasn't given to make these changes, and now I can't find anything, can't open emails, can't copy and paste, and the list goes on and on,\" one customer noted. Microsoft explained in a recent support document that the mouse pointer (and in some cases the cursor) will suddenly vanish as users move it across Outlook's interface, and noted that this bug also affects some users of other Microsoft 365 apps. \"When using classic Outlook, you may find that the mouse pointer or mouse cursor disappears as you move the pointer over the Outlook interface,\" it said. \"Although the mouse pointer is not there, the email in the message list will change color as you hover over it. This issue has also been reported with OneNote and other Microsoft 365 apps to a lesser degree.\" Microsoft added that the Outlook team is investigating the issues and will provide updates as more information becomes available. In the meantime, Microsoft is asking affected users to have their Microsoft 365 administrator open a support case with the Outlook Support Team and submit diagnostic log files to assist with analysis. While a timeline for a permanent fix is not yet available, Microsoft has offered three temporary workarounds that require affected users to click an email in the message list when the cursor disappears, which may cause it to reappear. Alternatively, switching to PowerPoint, clicking into an editable area, and then returning to Outlook may also restore the mouse pointer. If neither of them works, Microsoft said that restarting the computer should resolve the issue temporarily. Last month, Microsoft fixed another classic Outlook issue that prevented Microsoft 365 customers from opening encrypted emails after installing the December 2025 updates.

                                    "description": "New York-based ad tech company Optimizely has notified an undisclosed number of customers of a data breach after threat actors compromised some of its systems in a voice phishing attack. Optimizely has nearly 1,500 employees across 21 global offices, and its customer list includes over 10,000 businesses, including high-profile brands like H&M, PayPal, Zoom, Toyota, Vodafone, Shell, Salesforce, and Nike. In breach notification letters sent to affected customers, the company, the threat actors reached out on February 11, claiming they had access to its systems. Optimizely also told BleepingComputer that the attackers breached some of its systems and stole what it described as \"basic business contact information.\" \"The threat actor gained access to Optimizely's systems through a sophisticated voice-phishing attack, but was unable to escalate privileges, install software, or create any backdoors in the Optimizely environment, and we have no evidence that the threat actor was able to access sensitive customer data or personal information beyond basic business contact information,\" it said. Optimizely also noted the \"incident was confined to certain internal business systems, records in our CRM, and a limited set of internal documents used for back-office operations,\" and added that its \"business operations continue without disruption.\" The company also warned customers to be wary of attacks that could use some of the stolen data in further phishing attempts, which may use calls, texts, or emails to ask for passwords, MFA codes, or other credentials. While Optimizely didn't share how many customers had their information exposed in the data breach and has yet to name the threat actor behind the attack, it told affected customers that \"the communication we received is consistent with the behavior of a loosely affiliated group who use sophisticated and aggressive social engineering tactics, most often involving voice phishing, to attempt to access their victims systems.\" This hints that the attackers are likely part of the ShinyHunters extortion operation, which has claimed similar breaches at Canada Goose, Panera Bread, Betterment, SoundCloud, PornHub, fintech firm Figure, and online dating giant Match Group (which owns multiple popular dating services, including Tinder, Hinge, Meetic, Match.com, and OkCupid) in recent weeks. While not all of these breaches are part of the same campaign, some victims had their systems compromised in a voice phishing (vishing) campaign targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at Microsoft, Okta, and Google across over 100 high-profile organizations. In these attacks, threat actors impersonate targets' IT support, call employees, and trick them into entering credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes on phishing sites mimicking their companies' login portals. As BleepingComputer first reported, the threat actors have also recently altered their social engineering attacks to use device code vishing, abusing the legitimate OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow to obtain Microsoft Entra authentication tokens.

                                    "description": "Most phishing websites are little more than static copies of login pages for popular online destinations, and they are often quickly taken down by anti-abuse activists and security firms. But a stealthy new phishing-as-a-service offering lets customers sidestep both of these pitfalls: It uses cleverly disguised links to load the target brand\u2019s real website, and then acts as a relay between the victim and the legitimate site \u2014 forwarding the victim\u2019s username, password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) code to the legitimate site and returning its responses. There are countless phishing kits that would-be scammers can use to get started, but successfully wielding them requires some modicum of skill in configuring servers, domain names, certificates, proxy services, and other repetitive tech drudgery. Enter Starkiller, a new phishing service that dynamically loads a live copy of the real login page and records everything the user types, proxying the data from the legitimate site back to the victim. According to an analysis of Starkiller by the security firm Abnormal AI, the service lets customers select a brand to impersonate (e.g., Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft et. al.) and generates a deceptive URL that visually mimics the legitimate domain while routing traffic through the attacker\u2019s infrastructure. For example, a phishing link targeting Microsoft customers appears as \u201clogin.microsoft.com@[malicious/shortened URL here].\u201d The \u201c@\u201d sign in the link trick is an oldie but goodie, because everything before the \u201c@\u201d in a URL is considered username data, and the real landing page is what comes after the \u201c@\u201d sign. Here\u2019s what it looks like in the target\u2019s browser: Image: Abnormal AI. The actual malicious landing page is blurred out in this picture, but we can see it ends in .ru. The service also offers the ability to insert links from different URL-shortening services. Once Starkiller customers select the URL to be phished, the service spins up a Docker container running a headless Chrome browser instance that loads the real login page, Abnormal found. \u201cThe container then acts as a man-in-the-middle reverse proxy, forwarding the end user\u2019s inputs to the legitimate site and returning the site\u2019s responses,\u201d Abnormal researchers Callie Baron and Piotr Wojtyla wrote in a blog post on Thursday. \u201cEvery keystroke, form submission, and session token passes through attacker-controlled infrastructure and is logged along the way.\u201d Starkiller in effect offers cybercriminals real-time session monitoring, allowing them to live-stream the target\u2019s screen as they interact with the phishing page, the researchers said. \u201cThe platform also includes keylogger capture for every keystroke, cookie and session token theft for direct account takeover, geo-tracking of targets, and automated Telegram alerts when new credentials come in,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCampaign analytics round out the operator experience with visit counts, conversion rates, and performance graphs\u2014the same kind of metrics dashboard a legitimate SaaS [software-as-a-service] platform would offer.\u201d Abnormal said the service also deftly intercepts and relays the victim\u2019s MFA credentials, since the recipient who clicks the link is actually authenticating with the real site through a proxy, and any authentication tokens submitted are then forwarded to the legitimate service in real time. \u201cThe attacker captures the resulting session cookies and tokens, giving them authenticated access to the account,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cWhen attackers relay the entire authentication flow in real time, MFA protections can be effectively neutralized despite functioning exactly as designed.\u201d The \u201cURL Masker\u201d feature of the Starkiller phishing service features options for configuring the malicious link.

                                    "description": "For the past week, the massive \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT) botnet known as Kimwolf has been disrupting The Invisible Internet Project (I2P), a decentralized, encrypted communications network designed to anonymize and secure online communications. I2P users started reporting disruptions in the network around the same time the Kimwolf botmasters began relying on it to evade takedown attempts against the botnet\u2019s control servers. Kimwolf is a botnet that surfaced in late 2025 and quickly infected millions of systems, turning poorly secured IoT devices like TV streaming boxes, digital picture frames and routers into relays for malicious traffic and abnormally large distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. I2P is a decentralized, privacy-focused network that allows people to communicate and share information anonymously. \u201cIt works by routing data through multiple encrypted layers across volunteer-operated nodes, hiding both the sender\u2019s and receiver\u2019s locations,\u201d the I2P website explains. \u201cThe result is a secure, censorship-resistant network designed for private websites, messaging, and data sharing.\u201d On February 3, I2P users began complaining on the organization\u2019s GitHub page about tens of thousands of routers suddenly overwhelming the network, preventing existing users from communicating with legitimate nodes. Users reported a rapidly increasing number of new routers joining the network that were unable to transmit data, and that the mass influx of new systems had overwhelmed the network to the point where users could no longer connect. I2P users complaining about service disruptions from a rapidly increasing number of routers suddenly swamping the network. When one I2P user asked whether the network was under attack, another user replied, \u201cLooks like it. My physical router freezes when the number of connections exceeds 60,000.\u201d A graph shared by I2P developers showing a marked drop in successful connections on the I2P network around the time the Kimwolf botnet started trying to use the network for fallback communications. The same day that I2P users began noticing the outages, the individuals in control of Kimwolf posted to their Discord channel that they had accidentally disrupted I2P after attempting to join 700,000 Kimwolf-infected bots as nodes on the network. The Kimwolf botmaster openly discusses what they are doing with the botnet in a Discord channel with my name on it. Although Kimwolf is known as a potent weapon for launching DDoS attacks, the outages caused this week by some portion of the botnet attempting to join I2P are what\u2019s known as a \u201cSybil attack,\u201d a threat in peer-to-peer networks where a single entity can disrupt the system by creating, controlling, and operating a large number of fake, pseudonymous identities. Indeed, the number of Kimwolf-infected routers that tried to join I2P this past week was many times the network\u2019s normal size. I2P\u2019s Wikipedia page says the network consists of roughly 55,000 computers distributed throughout the world, with each participant acting as both a router (to relay traffic) and a client. However, Lance James, founder of the New York City based cybersecurity consultancy Unit 221B and the original founder of I2P, told KrebsOnSecurity the entire I2P network now consists of between 15,000 and 20,000 devices on any given day. An I2P user posted this graph on Feb. 10, showing tens of thousands of routers \u2014 mostly from the United States \u2014 suddenly attempting to join the network. Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to document Kimwolf\u2019s unique spreading techniques. Brundage said the Kimwolf operator(s) have been trying to build a command and control network that can\u2019t easily be taken down by security companies and network operators that are working together to combat the spread of the botnet. Brundage said the people in control of Kimwolf have been experimenting with using I2P and a similar anonymity network \u2014 Tor \u2014 as",

                                    "description": "Microsoft today released updates to fix more than 50 security holes in its Windows operating systems and other software, including patches for a whopping six \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerabilities that attackers are already exploiting in the wild. Zero-day #1 this month is CVE-2026-21510, a security feature bypass vulnerability in Windows Shell wherein a single click on a malicious link can quietly bypass Windows protections and run attacker-controlled content without warning or consent dialogs. CVE-2026-21510 affects all currently supported versions of Windows. The zero-day flaw CVE-2026-21513 is a security bypass bug targeting MSHTML, the proprietary engine of the default Web browser in Windows. CVE-2026-21514 is a related security feature bypass in Microsoft Word. The zero-day CVE-2026-21533 allows local attackers to elevate their user privileges to \u201cSYSTEM\u201d level access in Windows Remote Desktop Services. CVE-2026-21519 is a zero-day elevation of privilege flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user\u2019s screen. Microsoft fixed a different zero-day in DWM just last month. The sixth zero-day is CVE-2026-21525, a potentially disruptive denial-of-service vulnerability in the Windows Remote Access Connection Manager, the service responsible for maintaining VPN connections to corporate networks. Chris Goettl at Ivanti reminds us Microsoft has issued several out-of-band security updates since January\u2019s Patch Tuesday. On January 17, Microsoft pushed a fix that resolved a credential prompt failure when attempting remote desktop or remote application connections. On January 26, Microsoft patched a zero-day security feature bypass vulnerability (CVE-2026-21509) in Microsoft Office. Kev Breen at Immersive notes that this month\u2019s Patch Tuesday includes several fixes for remote code execution vulnerabilities affecting GitHub Copilot and multiple integrated development environments (IDEs), including VS Code, Visual Studio, and JetBrains products. The relevant CVEs are CVE-2026-21516, CVE-2026-21523, and CVE-2026-21256. Breen said the AI vulnerabilities Microsoft patched this month stem from a command injection flaw that can be triggered through prompt injection, or tricking the AI agent into doing something it shouldn\u2019t \u2014 like executing malicious code or commands. \u201cDevelopers are high-value targets for threat actors, as they often have access to sensitive data such as API keys and secrets that function as keys to critical infrastructure, including privileged AWS or Azure API keys,\u201d Breen said. \u201cWhen organizations enable developers and automation pipelines to use LLMs and agentic AI, a malicious prompt can have significant impact. This does not mean organizations should stop using AI. It does mean developers should understand the risks, teams should clearly identify which systems and workflows have access to AI agents, and least-privilege principles should be applied to limit the blast radius if developer secrets are compromised.\u201d The SANS Internet Storm Center has a clickable breakdown of each individual fix this month from Microsoft, indexed by severity and CVSS score. Enterprise Windows admins involved in testing patches before rolling them out should keep an eye on askwoody.com, which often has the skinny on wonky updates.

                                    "description": "A prolific data ransom gang that calls itself Scattered Lapsus ShinyHunters (SLSH) has a distinctive playbook when it seeks to extort payment from victim firms: Harassing, threatening and even swatting executives and their families, all while notifying journalists and regulators about the extent of the intrusion. Some victims reportedly are paying \u2014 perhaps as much to contain the stolen data as to stop the escalating personal attacks. But a top SLSH expert warns that engaging at all beyond a \u201cWe\u2019re not paying\u201d response only encourages further harassment, noting that the group\u2019s fractious and unreliable history means the only winning move is not to pay. Unlike traditional, highly regimented Russia-based ransomware affiliate groups, SLSH is an unruly and somewhat fluid English-language extortion gang that appears uninterested in building a reputation of consistent behavior whereby victims might have some measure of confidence that the criminals will keep their word if paid. That\u2019s according to Allison Nixon, director of research at the New York City based security consultancy Unit 221B. Nixon has been closely tracking the criminal group and individual members as they bounce between various Telegram channels used to extort and harass victims, and she said SLSH differs from traditional data ransom groups in other important ways that argue against trusting them to do anything they say they\u2019ll do \u2014 such as destroying stolen data. Like SLSH, many traditional Russian ransomware groups have employed high-pressure tactics to force payment in exchange for a decryption key and/or a promise to delete stolen data, such as publishing a dark web shaming blog with samples of stolen data next to a countdown clock, or notifying journalists and board members of the victim company. But Nixon said the extortion from SLSH quickly escalates way beyond that \u2014 to threats of physical violence against executives and their families, DDoS attacks on the victim\u2019s website, and repeated email-flooding campaigns. SLSH is known for breaking into companies by phishing employees over the phone, and using the purloined access to steal sensitive internal data. In a January 30 blog post, Google\u2019s security forensics firm Mandiant said SLSH\u2019s most recent extortion attacks stem from incidents spanning early to mid-January 2026, when SLSH members pretended to be IT staff and called employees at targeted victim organizations claiming that the company was updating MFA settings. \u201cThe threat actor directed the employees to victim-branded credential harvesting sites to capture their SSO credentials and MFA codes, and then registered their own device for MFA,\u201d the blog post explained. Victims often first learn of the breach when their brand name is uttered on whatever ephemeral new public Telegram group chat SLSH is using to threaten, extort and harass their prey. According to Nixon, the coordinated harassment on the SLSH Telegram channels is part of a well-orchestrated strategy to overwhelm the victim organization by manufacturing humiliation that pushes them over the threshold to pay. Nixon said multiple executives at targeted organizations have been subject to \u201cswatting\u201d attacks, wherein SLSH communicated a phony bomb threat or hostage situation at the target\u2019s address in the hopes of eliciting a heavily armed police response at their home or place of work. \u201cA big part of what they\u2019re doing to victims is the psychological aspect of it, like harassing executives\u2019 kids and threatening the board of the company,\u201d Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. \u201cAnd while these victims are getting extortion demands, they\u2019re simultaneously getting outreach from media outlets saying, \u2018Hey, do you have any comments on the bad things we\u2019re going to write about you.\u201d In a blog post today, Unit 221B argues that no one should negotiate with SLSH because the group has demonstrated a willingness to extort victims based on promises that it has no intention to keep. Nixon points out that all of SLSH\u2019s known ",

Our January 8 story, Who Benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf Botnets?, cited multiple sources saying the current administrators of Kimwolf went by the nicknames \u201cDort\u201d and \u201cSnow.\u201d Earlier this month, a close former associate of Dort and Snow shared what they said was a screenshot the Kimwolf botmasters had taken while logged in to the Badbox 2.0 botnet control panel. That screenshot, a portion of which is shown below, shows seven authorized users of the control panel, including one that doesn\u2019t quite match the others: According to my source, the account \u201cABCD\u201d (the one that is logged in and listed in the top right of the screenshot) belongs to Dort, who somehow figured out how to add their email address as a valid user of the Badbox 2.0 botnet. The control panel for the Badbox 2.0 botnet lists seven authorized users and their email addresses. Click to enlarge. Badbox has a storied history that well predates Kimwolf\u2019s rise in October 2025. In July 2025, Google filed a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d lawsuit (PDF) against 25 unidentified defendants accused of operating Badbox 2.0, which Google described as a botnet of over ten million unsanctioned Android streaming devices engaged in advertising fraud. Google said Badbox 2.0, in addition to compromising multiple types of devices prior to purchase, also can infect devices by requiring the download of malicious apps from unofficial marketplaces. Google\u2019s lawsuit came on the heels of a June 2025 advisory from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which warned that cyber criminals were gaining unauthorized access to home networks by either configuring the products with malware prior to the user\u2019s purchase, or infecting the device as it downloads required applications that contain backdoors \u2014 usually during the set-up process. The FBI said Badbox 2.0 was discovered after the original Badbox campaign was disrupted in 2024. The original Badbox was identified in 2023, and primarily consisted of Android operating system devices (TV boxes) that were compromised with backdoor malware prior to purchase. KrebsOnSecurity was initially skeptical of the claim that the Kimwolf botmasters had hacked the Badbox 2.0 botnet. That is, until we began digging into the history of the qq.com email addresses in the screenshot above. An online search for the address 34557257@qq.com (pictured in the screenshot above as the user \u201cChen\u201c) shows it is listed as a point of contact for a number of China-based technology companies, including: \u2013Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science & Technology Co Ltd. \u2013Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile Media Technology Co. Ltd. \u2013Moxin Beijing Science and Technology Co. Ltd. The website for Beijing Hong Dake Wang Science is asmeisvip[.]net, a domain that was flagged in a March 2025 report by HUMAN Security as one of several dozen sites tied to the distribution and management of the Badbox 2.0 botnet. Ditto for moyix[.]com, a domain associated with Beijing Hengchuang Vision Mobile.

                                    "description": "A new Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet called Kimwolf has spread to more than 2 million devices, forcing infected systems to participate in massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay other malicious and abusive Internet traffic. Kimwolf\u2019s ability to scan the local networks of compromised systems for other IoT devices to infect makes it a sobering threat to organizations, and new research reveals Kimwolf is surprisingly prevalent in government and corporate networks. Kimwolf grew rapidly in the waning months of 2025 by tricking various \u201cresidential proxy\u201d services into relaying malicious commands to devices on the local networks of those proxy endpoints. Residential proxies are sold as a way to anonymize and localize one\u2019s Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their Internet activity through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe. The malware that turns one\u2019s Internet connection into a proxy node is often quietly bundled with various mobile apps and games, and it typically forces the infected device to relay malicious and abusive traffic \u2014 including ad fraud, account takeover attempts, and mass content-scraping. Kimwolf mainly targeted proxies from IPIDEA, a Chinese service that has millions of proxy endpoints for rent on any given week. The Kimwolf operators discovered they could forward malicious commands to the internal networks of IPIDEA proxy endpoints, and then programmatically scan for and infect other vulnerable devices on each endpoint\u2019s local network. Most of the systems compromised through Kimwolf\u2019s local network scanning have been unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. These are typically Android Open Source Project devices \u2014 not Android TV OS devices or Play Protect certified Android devices \u2014 and they are generally marketed as a way to watch unlimited (read:pirated) video content from popular subscription streaming services for a one-time fee. However, a great many of these TV boxes ship to consumers with residential proxy software pre-installed. What\u2019s more, they have no real security or authentication built-in: If you can communicate directly with the TV box, you can also easily compromise it with malware. While IPIDEA and other affected proxy providers recently have taken steps to block threats like Kimwolf from going upstream into their endpoints (reportedly with varying degrees of success), the Kimwolf malware remains on millions of infected devices. Kimwolf\u2019s close association with residential proxy networks and compromised Android TV boxes might suggest we\u2019d find relatively few infections on corporate networks. However, the security firm Infoblox said a recent review of its customer traffic found nearly 25 percent of them made a query to a Kimwolf-related domain name since October 1, 2025, when the botnet first showed signs of life. Infoblox found the affected customers are based all over the world and in a wide range of industry verticals, from education and healthcare to government and finance. \u201cTo be clear, this suggests that nearly 25% of customers had at least one device that was an endpoint in a residential proxy service targeted by Kimwolf operators,\u201d Infoblox explained. \u201cSuch a device, maybe a phone or a laptop, was essentially co-opted by the threat actor to probe the local network for vulnerable devices. A query means a scan was made, not that new devices were compromised. Lateral movement would fail if there were no vulnerable devices to be found or if the DNS resolution was blocked.\u201d Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services and was the first to disclose on January 2 the unique methods Kimwolf uses to spread, found proxy endpoints from IPIDEA were present in alarming numbers at government and academic institutions worldwide. Synthient said it spied at least 33,000 affected Internet addresses at universities and colleges, and nearly 8,000 IPIDEA proxies within various U.S. and foreign government ",

                                    "description": "Microsoft today issued patches to plug at least 113 security holes in its various Windows operating systems and supported software. Eight of the vulnerabilities earned Microsoft\u2019s most-dire \u201ccritical\u201d rating, and the company warns that attackers are already exploiting one of the bugs fixed today. January\u2019s Microsoft zero-day flaw \u2014 CVE-2026-20805 \u2014 is brought to us by a flaw in the Desktop Window Manager (DWM), a key component of Windows that organizes windows on a user\u2019s screen. Kev Breen, senior director of cyber threat research at Immersive, said despite awarding CVE-2026-20805 a middling CVSS score of 5.5, Microsoft has confirmed its active exploitation in the wild, indicating that threat actors are already leveraging this flaw against organizations. Breen said vulnerabilities of this kind are commonly used to undermine Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a core operating system security control designed to protect against buffer overflows and other memory-manipulation exploits. \u201cBy revealing where code resides in memory, this vulnerability can be chained with a separate code execution flaw, transforming a complex and unreliable exploit into a practical and repeatable attack,\u201d Breen said. \u201cMicrosoft has not disclosed which additional components may be involved in such an exploit chain, significantly limiting defenders\u2019 ability to proactively threat hunt for related activity. As a result, rapid patching currently remains the only effective mitigation.\u201d Chris Goettl, vice president of product management at Ivanti, observed that CVE-2026-20805 affects all currently supported and extended security update supported versions of the Windows OS. Goettl said it would be a mistake to dismiss the severity of this flaw based on its \u201cImportant\u201d rating and relatively low CVSS score. \u201cA risk-based prioritization methodology warrants treating this vulnerability as a higher severity than the vendor rating or CVSS score assigned,\u201d he said. Among the critical flaws patched this month are two Microsoft Office remote code execution bugs (CVE-2026-20952 and CVE-2026-20953) that can be triggered just by viewing a booby-trapped message in the Preview Pane. Our October 2025 Patch Tuesday \u201cEnd of 10\u201d roundup noted that Microsoft had removed a modem driver from all versions after it was discovered that hackers were abusing a vulnerability in it to hack into systems. Adam Barnett at Rapid7 said Microsoft today removed another couple of modem drivers from Windows for a broadly similar reason: Microsoft is aware of functional exploit code for an elevation of privilege vulnerability in a very similar modem driver, tracked as CVE-2023-31096. \u201cThat\u2019s not a typo; this vulnerability was originally published via MITRE over two years ago, along with a credible public writeup by the original researcher,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cToday\u2019s Windows patches remove agrsm64.sys and agrsm.sys. All three modem drivers were originally developed by the same now-defunct third party, and have been included in Windows for decades. These driver removals will pass unnoticed for most people, but you might find active modems still in a few contexts, including some industrial control systems.\u201d According to Barnett, two questions remain: How many more legacy modem drivers are still present on a fully-patched Windows asset; and how many more elevation-to-SYSTEM vulnerabilities will emerge from them before Microsoft cuts off attackers who have been enjoying \u201cliving off the land[line] by exploiting an entire class of dusty old device drivers?\u201d \u201cAlthough Microsoft doesn\u2019t claim evidence of exploitation for CVE-2023-31096, the relevant 2023 write-up and the 2025 removal of the other Agere modem driver have provided two strong signals for anyone looking for Windows exploits in the meantime,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cIn case you were wondering, there is no need to have a modem connected; the mere presence of the driver is enough to render an asset vulnerable.\u201d Immersive, Ivanti and Rapid7 all called",

                                    "description": "Our first story of 2026 revealed how a destructive new botnet called Kimwolf has infected more than two million devices by mass-compromising a vast number of unofficial Android TV streaming boxes. Today, we\u2019ll dig through digital clues left behind by the hackers, network operators and services that appear to have benefitted from Kimwolf\u2019s spread. On Dec. 17, 2025, the Chinese security firm XLab published a deep dive on Kimwolf, which forces infected devices to participate in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and to relay abusive and malicious Internet traffic for so-called \u201cresidential proxy\u201d services. The software that turns one\u2019s device into a residential proxy is often quietly bundled with mobile apps and games. Kimwolf specifically targeted residential proxy software that is factory installed on more than a thousand different models of unsanctioned Android TV streaming devices. Very quickly, the residential proxy\u2019s Internet address starts funneling traffic that is linked to ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping. The XLab report explained its researchers found \u201cdefinitive evidence\u201d that the same cybercriminal actors and infrastructure were used to deploy both Kimwolf and the Aisuru botnet \u2014 an earlier version of Kimwolf that also enslaved devices for use in DDoS attacks and proxy services. XLab said it suspected since October that Kimwolf and Aisuru had the same author(s) and operators, based in part on shared code changes over time. But it said those suspicions were confirmed on December 8 when it witnessed both botnet strains being distributed by the same Internet address at 93.95.112[.]59. Public records show the Internet address range flagged by XLab is assigned to Lehi, Utah-based Resi Rack LLC. Resi Rack\u2019s website bills the company as a \u201cPremium Game Server Hosting Provider.\u201d Meanwhile, Resi Rack\u2019s ads on the Internet moneymaking forum BlackHatWorld refer to it as a \u201cPremium Residential Proxy Hosting and Proxy Software Solutions Company.\u201d Resi Rack co-founder Cassidy Hales told KrebsOnSecurity his company received a notification on December 10 about Kimwolf using their network \u201cthat detailed what was being done by one of our customers leasing our servers.\u201d \u201cWhen we received this email we took care of this issue immediately,\u201d Hales wrote in response to an email requesting comment. \u201cThis is something we are very disappointed is now associated with our name and this was not the intention of our company whatsoever.\u201d The Resi Rack Internet address cited by XLab on December 8 came onto KrebsOnSecurity\u2019s radar more than two weeks before that. Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that tracks proxy services. In late October 2025, Brundage shared that the people selling various proxy services which benefitted from the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets were doing so at a new Discord server called resi[.]to. On November 24, 2025, a member of the resi-dot-to Discord channel shares an IP address responsible for proxying traffic over Android TV streaming boxes infected by the Kimwolf botnet. When KrebsOnSecurity joined the resi[.]to Discord channel in late October as a silent lurker, the server had fewer than 150 members, including \u201cShox\u201d \u2014 the nickname used by Resi Rack\u2019s co-founder Mr. Hales \u2014 and his business partner \u201cLinus,\u201d who did not respond to requests for comment. Other members of the resi[.]to Discord channel would periodically post new IP addresses that were responsible for proxying traffic over the Kimwolf botnet. As the screenshot from resi[.]to above shows, that Resi Rack Internet address flagged by XLab was used by Kimwolf to direct proxy traffic as far back as November 24, if not earlier. All told, Synthient said it tracked at least seven static Resi Rack IP addresses connected to Kimwolf proxy infrastructure between October and December 2025. Neither of Resi Rack\u2019s co-owners responded to follow-up questions. Both have been active in selling proxy services via Discord for n",

                                    "description": "The story you are reading is a series of scoops nestled inside a far more urgent Internet-wide security advisory. The vulnerability at issue has been exploited for months already, and it\u2019s time for a broader awareness of the threat. The short version is that everything you thought you knew about the security of the internal network behind your Internet router probably is now dangerously out of date. The security company Synthient currently sees more than 2 million infected Kimwolf devices distributed globally but with concentrations in Vietnam, Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States. Synthient found that two-thirds of the Kimwolf infections are Android TV boxes with no security or authentication built in. The past few months have witnessed the explosive growth of a new botnet dubbed Kimwolf, which experts say has infected more than 2 million devices globally. The Kimwolf malware forces compromised systems to relay malicious and abusive Internet traffic \u2014 such as ad fraud, account takeover attempts and mass content scraping \u2014 and participate in crippling distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks capable of knocking nearly any website offline for days at a time. More important than Kimwolf\u2019s staggering size, however, is the diabolical method it uses to spread so quickly: By effectively tunneling back through various \u201cresidential proxy\u201d networks and into the local networks of the proxy endpoints, and by further infecting devices that are hidden behind the assumed protection of the user\u2019s firewall and Internet router. Residential proxy networks are sold as a way for customers to anonymize and localize their Web traffic to a specific region, and the biggest of these services allow customers to route their traffic through devices in virtually any country or city around the globe. The malware that turns an end-user\u2019s Internet connection into a proxy node is often bundled with dodgy mobile apps and games. These residential proxy programs also are commonly installed via unofficial Android TV boxes sold by third-party merchants on popular e-commerce sites like Amazon, BestBuy, Newegg, and Walmart. These TV boxes range in price from $40 to $400, are marketed under a dizzying range of no-name brands and model numbers, and frequently are advertised as a way to stream certain types of subscription video content for free. But there\u2019s a hidden cost to this transaction: As we\u2019ll explore in a moment, these TV boxes make up a considerable chunk of the estimated two million systems currently infected with Kimwolf. Some of the unsanctioned Android TV boxes that come with residential proxy malware pre-installed. Image: Synthient. Kimwolf also is quite good at infecting a range of Internet-connected digital photo frames that likewise are abundant at major e-commerce websites. In November 2025, researchers from Quokka published a report (PDF) detailing serious security issues in Android-based digital picture frames running the Uhale app \u2014 including Amazon\u2019s bestselling digital frame as of March 2025. There are two major security problems with these photo frames and unofficial Android TV boxes. The first is that a considerable percentage of them come with malware pre-installed, or else require the user to download an unofficial Android App Store and malware in order to use the device for its stated purpose (video content piracy). The most typical of these uninvited guests are small programs that turn the device into a residential proxy node that is resold to others. The second big security nightmare with these photo frames and unsanctioned Android TV boxes is that they rely on a handful of Internet-connected microcomputer boards that have no discernible security or authentication requirements built-in. In other words, if you are on the same network as one or more of these devices, you can likely compromise them simultaneously by issuing a single command across the network. The combination of these two security realities came to t",

A huge \u201cthank you\u201d to all of our readers \u2014 newcomers, long-timers and drive-by critics alike. Your engagement this past year here has been tremendous and truly a salve on a handful of dark days. Happily, comeuppance was a strong theme running through our coverage in 2025, with a primary focus on entities that enabled complex and globally-dispersed cybercrime services. Image: Shutterstock, Younes Stiller Kraske. In May 2024, we scrutinized the history and ownership of Stark Industries Solutions Ltd., a \u201cbulletproof hosting\u201d provider that came online just two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine and served as a primary staging ground for repeated Kremlin cyberattacks and disinformation efforts. A year later, Stark and its two co-owners were sanctioned by the European Union, but our analysis showed those penalties have done little to stop the Stark proprietors from rebranding and transferring considerable network assets to other entities they control. In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity profiled Cryptomus, a financial firm registered in Canada that emerged as the payment processor of choice for dozens of Russian cryptocurrency exchanges and websites hawking cybercrime services aimed at Russian-speaking customers. In October 2025, Canadian financial regulators ruled that Cryptomus had grossly violated its anti-money laundering laws, and levied a record $176 million fine against the platform. In September 2023, KrebsOnSecurity published findings from researchers who concluded that a series of six-figure cyberheists across dozens of victims resulted from thieves cracking master passwords stolen from the password manager service LastPass in 2022. In a court filing in March 2025, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion. Phishing was a major theme of this year\u2019s coverage, which peered inside the day-to-day operations of several voice phishing gangs that routinely carried out elaborate, convincing, and financially devastating cryptocurrency thefts. A Day in the Life of a Prolific Voice Phishing Crew examined how one cybercrime gang abused legitimate services at Apple and Google to force a variety of outbound communications to their users, including emails, automated phone calls and system-level messages sent to all signed-in devices. Nearly a half-dozen stories in 2025 dissected the incessant SMS phishing or \u201csmishing\u201d coming from China-based phishing kit vendors, who make it easy for customers to convert phished payment card data into mobile wallets from Apple and Google. In an effort to wrest control over this phishing syndicate\u2019s online resources, Google has since filed at least two John Doe lawsuits targeting these groups and dozens of unnamed defendants. In January, we highlighted research into a dodgy and sprawling content delivery network called Funnull that specialized in helping China-based gambling and money laundering websites distribute their operations across multiple U.S.-based cloud providers. Five months later, the U.S. government sanctioned Funnull, identifying it as a top source of investment/romance scams known as \u201cpig butchering.\u201d In May, Pakistan arrested 21 people alleged to be working for Heartsender, a phishing and malware dissemination service that KrebsOnSecurity first profiled back in 2015. The arrests came shortly after the FBI and the Dutch police seized dozens of servers and domains for the group. Many of those arrested were first publicly identified in a 2021 story here about how they\u2019d inadvertently infected their computers with malware that gave away their real-life identities. In April, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted the proprietors of a Pakistan-based e-commerce company for conspiring to distribute synthetic opioids in the United States. The following month, KrebsOnSecurity detailed how the proprietors of the sanctioned entity are perhaps better known for ",
